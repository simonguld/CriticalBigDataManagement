Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem, affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially, and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing ""westernization"" or modernization. Multiple risk factors of diabetes, delayed diagnosis until micro- and macro-vascular complications arise, life-threatening complications, failure of the current therapies, and financial costs for the treatment of this disease, make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, the roles of genes, lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The core aims are to bring forward the new therapy strategies and cost-effective intervention trials of type 2 diabetes.""","genetic factor, intervention trial., lifestyle, treatment, type 2 diabetes, ","""1.

A strong family history of diabetes mellitus, age, obesity, and physical inactivity identify those individuals at highest risk. Minority populations are also at higher risk, not only because of family history and genetics, but also because of adaptation to American environmental influences of poor dietary and exercise habits. Women with a history of gestational diabetes as well as their children are at greater risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance increases a person's risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Individuals who have insulin resistance share many of the same risk factors as those with type 2 diabetes. These include hyperinsulinemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, prothrombic state, hyperuricemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Current interventions for the prevention and retardation of type 2 diabetes mellitus are those targeted towards modifying environmental risk factors such as reducing obesity and promoting physical activity. Awareness of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes will promote screening, early detection, and treatment in high-risk populations with the goal of decreasing both microvascular and macrovascular complications.""",,"""University of North Florida, Department of Nursing Jacksonville Beach, USA."", "

This paper focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and excess fatty acids increase oxidative stress, disrupt protein kinase C signaling and increase advanced glycation end-products that result in vascular inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and atherogenesis. Intensive T2D treatment produces a ≥10% risk reduction in major macrovascular and microvascular events. Glucose-lowering therapies must be individualized. Metformin is an optimal drug for monotherapy.

T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.""",,"""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", ""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", ""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", "

These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM.

The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.""","Abnormal insulin secretion, Disease trajectory, Hyperinsulinemia, Insulin resistance, Prediabetes, ","""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China."", ""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China."", ""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China. wangsongtao@m.scnu.edu.cn."", "

This is coincident with an overall 33% increase in DM prevalence documented during the last decade. In 1992, type 2 DM was a rare occurrence in most pediatric centers. By 1994, it represented up to 16% of new cases in urban areas, and by 1999, the incidence of new type 2 DM diagnoses ranged between 8% and 45%, depending on geographic location. These patients have been observed primarily in African American, Mexican American, Native American, and Asian American children and youth. As in the adult population, type 2 DM in children and youth occurs as a result of insulin resistance coupled with relative beta-cell failure. While there appears to be a host of potential genetic and environmental risk factors for these aberrations, perhaps the most significant risk factor is obesity. Other risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM, puberty, intrauterine exposure to DM, sedentary lifestyle, female gender, and certain ethnicities. To date, few studies have addressed the role of physical activity and nutrition counseling in improving glycemic outcome, the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular risk, or the most effective treatment regimens for this population. Once type 2 DM is established, the persistence of obesity often interferes with the response to treatment and exacerbates the comorbidities of hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Since fewer than 10% of youth with type 2 DM can be treated with diet and exercise alone, pharmacological intervention is generally required to achieve normoglycemic targets. In most surveys, practitioners prescribe insulin or an oral agent, most often metformin.

Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship.

However, the development of this association over time and the quantification of the strength of this association for individual BCAAs prior to T2DM diagnosis remains unexplored. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the Healthcare Databases Advance Search (HDAS) via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. The data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for all papers from inception until November 2021. Nine studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Stratification was based on follow-up times (0−6, 6−12 and 12 or more years) and controlling of body mass index (BMI) through the specific assessment of overweight cohorts was also undertaken. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between BCAA concentrations and the development of T2DM, with valine OR = 2.08 (95% CI = 2.04−2.12, p < 0.00001), leucine OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.76−2.87, p < 0.00001) and isoleucine OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 2.00−2.25, p < 0.00001.

The risk of type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as body mass index rises above 25 kg/m(2). Obesity currently costs the Canadian economy approximately $7.1 billion annually whereas per capita health care cost for individuals with diabetes are 3 to 4 times that for persons without the disease. Each kilogram of weight lost through health behaviour changes in people with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a relative diabetes risk reduction of 16%. As 80% to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and adiposity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes, weight loss is recommended as the cornerstone management measure. A modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is an achievable and realistic goal for preventing type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals and improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with type 2 diabetes. When health behaviour modification fails to achieve glycemic and metabolic goal targets, priority should be given to antihyperglycemic agents that are associated with weight loss or weight neutrality.

Globally, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has become a significant international public health concern. In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes, and further, to reduce its growing incidence, it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment. Although many factors cause T2DM, this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism. The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness. Nocturnal light exposure, unusual timing of food, irregular sleep/wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock. Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis. This strategy thus represents a chronotherapeutic option for non-pharmaceutical intervention in treating T2DM patients.""","Circadian rhythms, Clock genes, Melatonin., Metabolism, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, ","""Department of Animal Behaviour, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai 625 021, Tamil Nadu, India."", ""Department of Animal Behaviour, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai 625 021, Tamil Nadu, India.

Glycemic control is an important part in management of DM. The first line in treatment of type 2 DM (T2DM) is diet and life style change. Metformin is the first choice of medication in T2DM patients. Sulfonylureas have high risk of hypoglycemia. Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas. Also, α-glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These have no risk for hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner.

The concerning upswing in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has continued, parallel to the increasing rates of obesity. The disease is not specific to the U.S.; it has proven to be a global problem. The current information on type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents is mostly extrapolated from studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, due to the paucity of studies conducted in youth. Obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, minority ethnicity and race, polycystic ovary syndrome, maternal diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during gestation, and acanthosis nigricans are the major risk factors and markers of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiology, which involves both an insulin secretion defect and resistance to insulin, needs further clarification in pediatric studies. Current management approaches involve lifestyle modification (nutritional and exercise) along with pharmacologic agents, such as insulin and oral antihyperglycemic medications, as indicated. A recent study on the use of metformin in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated the drug to be effective and to have a good safety profile in this population.

An update."", ",Jun. 1999,"""Exercise has long been considered a cornerstone in the treatment regimen for patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Aerobic endurance exercise has traditionally been advocated as the most suitable exercise mode. Several exercise studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results obtained have been highly heterogeneous regarding the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control. Only in certain subgroups (e.g. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under 55 years of age, those with diabetes treated through diet and those who have diabetes with fairly good metabolic control), does exercise seem to be beneficial with regard to improvement in glycaemic control. There has been little research into the effects of resistance training on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the amount of research involving aerobic endurance exercise. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with increasing age, partly because of the decline in muscle mass associated with aging. This corresponds with a decline in metabolic function, supporting the usefulness of resistance training. Available studies support the usefulness of resistance training in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, based on the published studies reviewed, this author proposes that an optimal exercise programme for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus should include components that improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, i.e. a combination of aerobic endurance training and circuit-type resistance training. Programmes combining various modes of exercise positively influence patient compliance with the exercise programme. The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can undertake an individualised exercise programme without significantly increased risks of complications.""",,"""National Public Health Institute, Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion, Helsinki, Finland. johan.eriksson@ktl.fi"", "

The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, in terms of unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several factors, most notably insulin resistance, associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient's absolute risk.""","Atherosclerosis, Cardiovascular risk factors, Dyslipidemia, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, Polypharmacy, Triglycerides, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, ","""Diabetes/Lipid Management & Research Center, 18821 Delaware St, Suite 202, Huntington Beach, CA, 92648, USA. pdrosenblit@yahoo.com."", ""Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine (UCI) School of Medicine, Irvine, CA, USA. pdrosenblit@yahoo.com."", "

Fear of falling and low balance confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE and PubMed was conducted. The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet* AND fear OR falls AND self-efficacy OR balance confidence. Inclusion criteria were 1) population: older adults (≥65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes; and 2) outcome measure: balance confidence or fear of falling. We included 21 studies: fear of falling (n=14); balance confidence (n=7). We categorized them into 4 themes: prevalence, severity, determinants and interventions. Determinants were further categorized into physical, psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions (e.g. gait and balance training, tai chi, yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence. Future work is needed to generate best practices related to fear of falling and low balance confidence in older adults with type 2 diabetes.""","aging, balance, chutes, falls, mobility, mobilité, vieillissement, équilibre, ","""Geriatric Education and Research in Aging Sciences, Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada."", ""Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Rehabilitation Therapy, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and a relative beta-cell defect are the underlying pathologic problems leading to hyperglycemia. Notably, insulin resistance is also associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Diabetes can be defined as a disease of accelerated cardiovascular deterioration associated with elevated blood glucose levels. Glycemic control has been shown to reduce the long-term complications associated with diabetes. Although medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed increased physical activity are important components of a diabetes management plan, most patients need medication to lower glucose to near-normal levels. Therapeutic options for treating hyperglycemia include sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. An antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity is an excellent choice for early treatment of type 2 diabetes because it may delay or prevent complications associated with this disease.

This magnesium-binding defect (MgBD) consists of a decreased content of tightly bound Mg2+ ion in the cell membrane and limits the amount of Mg2+ that enters the cell, some of which combines with ATP4-, produced by the cell, to form MgATP2-, the currency of metabolic energy. Consequently, in both prediabetes and overt diabetes, the intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2+ and MgATP2- ions is significantly less than normal. These 2 ions are required as cofactors and (or) substrates for some 300 enzyme systems in human metabolism, many of which are involved with insulin. Thus the decreased activities of particular ones of these enzyme systems due to the decreased intracellular [Mg2+] and its dependent [MgATP2-] are responsible for (i) insulin resistance and (ii) decreased insulin secretion and (or) production, the 2 pathophysiological processes required for the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These 2 processes can account for all of the morbid symptoms associated with this disease. Thus, the decreased intracellular concentration of the interdependent Mg2+ and MgATP2- ions constitutes the etiology of genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes mellitus and can be corrected by 2 identified peptide Mg2+-binding promoters that are derived from the carboxyl terminal of the tachykinin substance P and occur in normal blood plasma. Decreased intracellular [Mg2+] and [MgATP2-] can also result from a dietary deficiency of magnesium or from an abnormal accumulation of saturated fatty acids in cell membranes, which inhibits the entrance of Mg2+ into the cell; thus it is also the etiology not only of diabetes caused by magnesium deficiency, but also of the ""lipotoxic"" type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although these pathologies cannot be corrected by the Mg2+-binding promoters, they can be corrected, respectively, by dietary magnesium supplementation or by exercise plus dietary caloric and lipid restriction.

In this regard, the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro- and macro-vascular complications. In this article, we have briefly described the role of various causative factors, transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress, a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM.

Therefore, diabetes self-management education (DSME) (and support DSMES) plays a significant role to increase patient's self-management capacity and improve diabetes therapy. Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed. Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behavior or stressor and similar characteristics as the target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA1c, cardiovascular disease risk factors or self-efficacy at a lower cost compared to standard therapy. Peer-supported instant messaging services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared to standard therapy. The major objective of the study is to analyze the impact of a peer-supported IMS intervention in addition to a standard diabetes therapy on the glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients.""","Austria, Diabetes self-management (support), Glycemic control, Instant messaging service, Peer support, Quality of life, Randomized controlled trial, Social support, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, ","""Institute of Health Sciences, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria. elisabeth.hoeld@fhstp.ac.at."", ""Institute of Creative\Media/Technologies, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital St. Pölten, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Bachelor Degree Program Dietetics, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Department of Psychology and Psychodynamics, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems an der Donau, Austria."", ""Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital St. Pölten, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Fachbereich Versorgungsmanagement 3, Austrian Health Insurance Fund, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Fachbereich Versorgungsmanagement 3, Austrian Health Insurance Fund, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Bachelor Degree Program Dietetics, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Institute of Creative\Media/Technologies, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Institute of Health Sciences, St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences, St. Pölten, Austria."", ""Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, Vienna, Austria."", "

In this retrospective study, we aim to address whether metformin use prior to admission decreases mortality in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1356 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus was analyzed by multivariable regression. Covariates that potentially confound the association were further adjusted using propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that metformin therapy prior to admission in patients with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with less primary outcome events including in-hospital mortality and hospice care enrollment with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.25 (95% CI 0.06-0.74) and less in-hospital length of stay, compared to the non-metformin group.

Glycemic control, lipid profiles, and adherence to standards of care are less than optimal in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes has an enormous economic impact, and its related costs in the United States are expected to increase as the frequency of the disease increases. A substantial portion of diabetes-related health care expenditures is allotted to the treatment of cardiovascular disease, a major complication of diabetes. Significant health care resources are spent in a reactive manner (i.e., after complications have developed), with little emphasis on preventive care. One large study conducted in the United Kingdom demonstrated that providing intensive blood glucose control significantly reduced the risk of microvascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Factors to consider in selecting pharmacotherapy for these patients include the magnitude of change in measures of glycemic control provided by the medication, other desired metabolic changes and outcomes (e.g., blood pressure and lipid changes), mechanism of action, adverse effects, contraindications, patient adherence, and cost. Early interventions, such as annual urinalysis and screening for microalbuminemia, annual comprehensive eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist, and screening for neuropathy and foot problems are cost-effective ways of reducing diabetes-related complications. Interventions recommended for reducing the risk for cardiovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus include lipid control, blood pressure control, aspirin therapy, smoking cessation, and weight loss.

Recent experimental and clinical studies show that both disorders are etiologically related to each other through the actions of osteocalcin and adiponectin. Meta-analyses of multiple clinical studies show that hip fracture risk of T2DM patients is increased to 1.4 to 1.7-folds, although BMD of the patients is not diminished. Vertebral fracture risk of T2DM patients is also increased, and BMD is not useful for assessing its risk. These findings suggest that bone fragility in T2DM depends on bone quality deterioration rather than bone mass reduction. Thus, surrogate markers are needed to replace the insensitivity of BMD in assessing fracture risks of T2DM patients. Markers related to advanced glycation end products as well as insulin-like growth factor-I may be such candidates, because these substances were experimentally shown to modulate bone quality in DM. In practice, it is important for physicians to assess fracture risk in T2DM patients by evaluating prior VFs and fracture histories using spine X-ray and interview, respectively, until the usefulness of surrogate markers is established.""",,"""Internal Medicine 1, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Japan. yamaguch@med.shimane-u.ac.jp"", "

In both cases (i.e. chronic hyperglycaemia and CV complications), significant diagnostic and treatment challenges resulting from a broad range of factors may serve as barriers to reducing the deleterious societal impact of T2DM and prediabetes. These challenges often include clinicians: failing to intervene early and aggressively enough among patients with T2DM to achieve CV risk factor control; failing to efficaciously identify T2DM patients with already established CV complications; and failing proactively to assess individuals at high risk for T2DM. This review discusses the apparent symbiosis between CV disease and T2DM, with a focus on identifying patients with established T2DM or at risk for T2DM; traditional and novel risk factors and markers for CV disease in T2DM; challenges related to diagnosing CV disease in T2DM; and organization of T2DM care in order to prevent CV complications. These are issues that require attention because identifying patients at high risk for T2DM can halt or reduce their further glycaemic deterioration if addressed properly, and because novel markers and non-invasive tests could be applied in patients with T2DM as a means of detecting and possibly treating unrecognized CV disease in time. Furthermore, several approaches for T2DM care can be effective in controlling the CV risk factors contributing to CV complications.""",,"""Medical Department, Asker and Baerum Hospital, Rud, Norway. odd.erik.johansen@broadpark.no"", "

The mitochondria electron transport chain is a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in insulin secretory cells, insulin peripheral sensitive cells and endothelial cells. Elevated intracellular glucose level induces tricarboxylic acid cycle electron donor overproduction and mitochondrial proton gradient increase leading to an increase in electron transporter lifetime. Subsequently, the electrons leaked combine with respiratory oxygen (O(2)) resulting in superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) production. Advanced glycation end products derive ROS via interaction with their receptors. Elevated diacylglycerol and ROS activate the protein kinase C pathway which, in turn, activates NADPH oxidases. A vicious circle of pathway derived ROS installs. Pathologic pathways induced ROS are activated and persistent though glycemia returns to normal due to hyperglycemia memory. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may produce both superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) and nitric oxide (NO) leading to peroxynitrite ((•)ONOO(-)) generation. Homocysteine is also implicated in oxidative stress pathogenesis. In this paper we have highlighted the pathologic mechanisms of ROS on atherosclerosis, renal dysfunction, retina dysfunction and nerve dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

Women with lesser degrees of glucose intolerance share the same risks. T2DM may occur from postpartum (5 to 14%) to several years later, up to 25 years. Some factors associated with T2DM are identified: obesity, early diagnostic before 24 weeks, high pregnancy OGTT blood glucose or insulinotherapy. Screening for T2DM only with fasting glucose provides less sensibility than with OGTT; HbA1c may supplant these dosages. The recurrence rate of GDM is between 30 and 84%, non-white ethnicity and insulinotherapy during GDM being the best proven predictors. High risk women need repeated life-long screenings for glycemic abnomalies, or when another pregnancy is planned. Among overweight or obese women with history of GDM who show minor glycoregulation disturbances, it is proved that modifications of lifestyle in intensive programs or metformin halve the risk of DT2. However, studies analysing practices show low adhesion to screening; without an intensive program, few women implement lifestyle modifications.

All these measures should be simplified, and sufficiently attractive to be acceptable and accepted by the patient. Weight-loss objectives in overweight diabetic patients should remain within reasonable limits: a few kilogram- loss is sufficient in many cases. In order to maintain the palatability of the diet, the dietary fat intake must be set at sufficient high levels, just by adjusting the carbohydrates/monounsaturates fat balance.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety more frequently than people without diabetes. Anxiety is traditionally associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased medical complications among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Collaborative care models have been utilized in the multidisciplinary treatment of mental health problems and chronic disease, and have demonstrated success in managing the pathology of depression which often accompanies diabetes. However, no specific treatment model has been published that links the treatment of anxiety to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the success of collaborative care models in treating depression associated with diabetes, and anxiety unrelated to chronic disease, it is possible that the collaborative care treatment of primary care patients who suffer from both anxiety and diabetes could be met with the same success. The key issue is determining how to implement and sustain these models in practice.

Obesity is a strong correlate, and the increasing prevalence of obesity and poor physical activity is precipitating type 2 DM at younger ages in the ethnic groups at risk. Indians and other South Asians are among the ethnic groups particularly prone to insulin resistance and type 2 DM, the other racial groups being some American Indian tribes like the Pima Indians, Mexican Americans,Pacific Islanders and African Americans,among others. The WHO has predicted that India will have the greatest number of diabetic individuals in the world by the year 2025. Type 2 DM starting during adolescence puts the individual at risk for major morbidity and even mortality right during the productive years of life. The microvascular complications of DM (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) are brought on at an early age. In addition, type 2 DM and obesity are two components of a metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, the other features of which include hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability of blood. All these conditions together increase the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke). The resulting economic burden will be enormous. Type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome are to a large extent preventable. Adoption of a healthy eating and physical activity pattern has resulted in decreasing the development of DM in a few recent studies from various parts of the world.

As in humans, type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes in NHPs and occurs more often in older obese animals, with a metabolic progression from insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes. Histopathologic changes in pancreatic islets are also similar to those seen in humans with diabetes. Initially, there is islet hyperplasia with abundant insulin production to compensate for IR, followed by insufficient insulin production with replacement of islets with islet-associated amyloid. Diabetic NHPs also have adverse changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, biomarkers of obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and protein glycation that contribute to the numerous complications of the disease. Furthermore, sex hormones, pregnancy, and environmental factors (e.g., diet and stress) affect IR and can also contribute to diabetes progression in NHPs. Additionally, due to their similar clinical and pathologic characteristics, NHPs have been used in many pharmacological studies to assess new therapeutic agents. For these reasons, NHPs are particularly valuable animal models of obesity and diabetes for studying disease pathogenesis, risk factors, comorbidities, and therapeutic interventions.""",,"""Department of Pathology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157, USA."", "

The global epidemic of obesity secondary to physical inactivity and adverse food habits accounts for the alarming rise in NAFLD. Metabolic syndrome plays a major role in the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whilst most cases of NAFLD remain asymptomatic with only hepatic steatosis, about 30 % progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with chronic liver inflammation that can lead on to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the similar pathogenesis shared between T2DM and NAFLD, T2DM occurs as an important complication in many cases of NAFLD, and many cases of T2DM are further complicated by NAFLD. Rapid progression and increased complications of the individual diseases is the end result of this dual coexistence. Diagnosis of NAFLD relies upon hepatic imaging, serum biochemical markers, and liver biopsy. As in T2DM, the most important management option for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle changes targeted at weight reduction. Other treatment options include insulin sensitizers (metformin and pioglitazone), vitamin E, incretin mimetics, omega-3 fatty acids, cholesterol lowering agents, orlistat, and bariatric surgery. The clinical spectrum, patho-physiological features and therapeutic options of NAFLD share many things in common with T2DM and therefore, this review is to highlight the diabetologist's perspective of the disease.""",,"""Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, University Hospital of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, ST4 6QG, UK, drpappachan@yahoo.co.in."", "

Data from large, prospective studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and the development of T2DM. Smaller, cross-sectional studies also support a relationship between short sleep duration and the development of both insulin resistance and T2DM. Intervention studies show that sleep restriction leads to insulin resistance, with recent sleep extension studies offering tantalising data showing a potential benefit of sleep extension on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. In people with established diabetes the published literature shows an association between poor glucose control and both short and long sleep durations.

Although recent studies suggest that primary prevention of NIDDM is possible, strategies for controlling the NIDDM pandemic remain under development. Successful interventions to date have mainly relied upon the control of obesity and increased exercise, although pharmacological agents are being studied. While a mixture of both high risk and population-based approaches is likely to be required, the former will not prevent new high risk cases developing. Unfortunately, the success in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease through risk factor reduction has not controlled obesity, the most important risk factor for NIDDM. New strategies are currently being developed and focus upon changes in the food supply of whole populations and a community development approach to altering attitudes to food and exercise. As these interventions are in the early stages of their development, formative, process, and quantitative evaluation remain essential components of any community-based programme aimed at the primary prevention of NIDDM.""",,"""South Auckland Academic Division, University of Auckland, Middlemore Hospital, New Zealand."", "

There is an abundance of evidence that diabetes mellitus play important etiological roles in periodontal diseases. In addition, periodontal diseases have powerful and multiple influences on the occurrence and severity of systemic conditions and diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and pregnancy complications. The relationship of periodontitis and diabetes has been supported by sufficient evidences in the past twenty years: (1) diabetes is an independent risk factor of chronic periodontitis; (2) metabolic control will improve the prognosis of chronic periodontitis; (3) the treatment of chronic periodontitis will improve the metabolic level. Our recent investigation on periodontal status in the families of type 2 diabetes mellitus further confirmed the relationship. It was showed that the periodontal index such as probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and numbers of tooth loss in diabetes family members were significantly higher than non-diabetes family members, while no difference of periodontal parameters was found between well control family members and non diabetes family members. In the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its complications, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its receptors were to be recognized as important factors. The distributions of AGEs and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) are highly consistent in various tissues. One study in our laboratory demonstrated that RAGE was strongly expressed in gingival tissues gathered from T2DM patients with periodontitis compared with systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients, the expression of RAGE was positively correlated with the expression of TNF-alpha, indicating that AGE-RAGE pathway was involved in the development of periodontitis in T2DM patients. It is known that inflammation could induce the prediabetic status characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. However, it is still unclear whether periodontitis is a risk factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus or not. In a current study, the effect of periodontitis on serum levels of lipid and glucose of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients was implied, as the average serum levels of triglycerides and glucose of a large number of AgP patients were both significantly higher than healthy control group, and serum level of total cholesterol in AgP group was positively associated with the percentage of severe attachment loss sites. It seems that periodontitis may alter serum lipid and glucose levels. Furthermore, the effect of periodontitis on diabetes in an animal study has also demonstrated that experimental moderate periodontitis as well as castration could induce insulin resistance and beta cell impairment in rats, and that combination of the two factors would aggravate the degree of insulin resistance (IR). In conclusion, interrelationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been further approved recently.""",,"""Department of Periodontitis, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. kqhxmeng@bjmu.edu.cn"", "

Older diabetic subjects have an increased frequency of complications from diabetes compared with their younger counterparts and higher morbidity and mortality rates compared with age-matched non-diabetic controls. Elderly patients with diabetes are generally treated following the same approach as in younger patients: dietary therapy first, followed by oral hypoglycaemic agents and ultimately insulin. However, several specificities should be pointed out. Changes associated with ageing may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both sulphonylureas (increasing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia) and biguanides (increasing the risk of lactic acidosis). The best insulin regimen in old age is not known, but a twice-daily injection of a pre-mixed insulin preparation is usually recommended. Goals of therapy must be realistic and not cause disabling side-effects.

It is an illness that requires long-term active patient participation to maintain metabolic control and challenges both the patient and health care provider. The need for the patient to carry out daily self-care behaviors is no less important simply because the person is older. Older adults, however, experience unique challenges because of the physical and functional changes that may be imposed by the aging process and the prevalence of multiple chronic illnesses and complications. Because diabetes self-care is carried out within the context of all aspects of a person's life, it is important, then, for the health professional to recognize these social, functional, and psychological challenges.

Chronic hyperglycemia is known to be a cause of the development and progression of T2D. As for effective diabetes control, there is strong evidence suggesting that better glycemic control can considerably reduce a risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy. To what values glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be reduced to prevent complications due to T2D, currently remains an urgent problem. Based on the largest studies dealing with this problem, recommendations have been formulated for different groups of patients: to achieve HbA1c levels of < 7% for all patients; < 6% for those at relatively low risk for hypoglycemia, and in the range from 7.5 to 8% for those at its high risk.""",,

Influence of obesity and physical inactivity."", ",Dec. 1987,"""The development of hyperglycemia in the elderly is often multifactorial in etiology, and its presentation is often confounded by the advanced age of the patient, the presence of coexisting diseases and altered mental states, the absence of symptoms, and physical conditions specific to the medical care of the geriatric patient. Manifestations of macro- and microvascular complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) often herald the disease in the elderly, yet there is incomplete knowledge of the natural history of the disease and poor guidelines for its effective management in the geriatric population. Once NIDDM is diagnosed in the older patient, the propensity for these patients to develop atherosclerotic vascular complications involving every organ system and the socioeconomic sequela of the disease make treatment prudent. Coexisting risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as dyshypoproteinemia, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking, should be treated vigorously, and poor diet, physical inactivity, and medications affecting glucose tolerance modified. Hyperglycemia resistant to nonpharmacologic therapy should be treated with second-generation oral sulfonylureas, and the judicious use of insulin is advised because of a heightened risk for the hazards of hypoglycemia in the elderly. The treatment of NIDDM has important implications in the elderly because of its prevalence and its association with other age-related pathophysiologic processes. Such effective treatment may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of older people.""",,"""Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."", "

Maturity-onset of diabetes of the young, or MODY, is a form of monogenic diabetes that is caused by mutations occurring in a number of different genes. Mutations in different genes tend to cause a slightly different variant of diabetes. MODY is typically diagnosed during late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and is usually observed to develop in adults during their late 50's. One of the main drawbacks in its diagnosis is that many people with MODY are misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a molecular and genetic diagnosis can result in a better treatment and could also help in identifying other family members with MODY.
