Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem, affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially, and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing ""westernization"" or modernization. Multiple risk factors of diabetes, delayed diagnosis until micro- and macro-vascular complications arise, life-threatening complications, failure of the current therapies, and financial costs for the treatment of this disease, make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, the roles of genes, lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The core aims are to bring forward the new therapy strategies and cost-effective intervention trials of type 2 diabetes.""","genetic factor, intervention trial., lifestyle, treatment, type 2 diabetes, ","""1.

A strong family history of diabetes mellitus, age, obesity, and physical inactivity identify those individuals at highest risk. Minority populations are also at higher risk, not only because of family history and genetics, but also because of adaptation to American environmental influences of poor dietary and exercise habits. Women with a history of gestational diabetes as well as their children are at greater risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance increases a person's risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Individuals who have insulin resistance share many of the same risk factors as those with type 2 diabetes. These include hyperinsulinemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, prothrombic state, hyperuricemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Current interventions for the prevention and retardation of type 2 diabetes mellitus are those targeted towards modifying environmental risk factors such as reducing obesity and promoting physical activity. Awareness of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes will promote screening, early detection, and treatment in high-risk populations with the goal of decreasing both microvascular and macrovascular complications.""",,"""University of North Florida, Department of Nursing Jacksonville Beach, USA."", "

T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.""",,"""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", ""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", ""Gender Medicine Unit (A.K.-W., J.H.), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria; and Metabolic Unit (G.P.), Institute of Neuroscience, National Research Council, 35127 Padua, Italy."", "

These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM.

Metabolic abnormalities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the main reasons. The prevalence of T2DM in patients with schizophrenia may be epidemiologically frequent because antipsychotics induce weight gain as a side effect and the cognitive dysfunction of patients with schizophrenia relates to a disordered lifestyle, poor diet, and low socioeconomic status. Apart from these common risk factors and risk factors unique to schizophrenia, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of common susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and T2DM. Functional proteins translated from common genetic susceptibility genes are known to regulate neuronal development in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through several common cascades.

Many genetic and epidemiological studies have reliably associated the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2DM, and it is probably safe to think that common cascades and mechanisms suspected from common genes' functions are related to the onset of both schizophrenia and T2DM. On the other hand, even when genetic analyses are performed on a relatively large number of comorbid patients, the results are sometimes inconsistent, and susceptibility genes may carry only a low or moderate risk.

Fear of falling and low balance confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE and PubMed was conducted. The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet* AND fear OR falls AND self-efficacy OR balance confidence. Inclusion criteria were 1) population: older adults (≥65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes; and 2) outcome measure: balance confidence or fear of falling. We included 21 studies: fear of falling (n=14); balance confidence (n=7). We categorized them into 4 themes: prevalence, severity, determinants and interventions. Determinants were further categorized into physical, psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions (e.g. gait and balance training, tai chi, yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence.

However, the development of this association over time and the quantification of the strength of this association for individual BCAAs prior to T2DM diagnosis remains unexplored. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the Healthcare Databases Advance Search (HDAS) via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. The data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for all papers from inception until November 2021. Nine studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Stratification was based on follow-up times (0−6, 6−12 and 12 or more years) and controlling of body mass index (BMI) through the specific assessment of overweight cohorts was also undertaken. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between BCAA concentrations and the development of T2DM, with valine OR = 2.08 (95% CI = 2.04−2.12, p < 0.00001), leucine OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.76−2.87, p < 0.00001) and isoleucine OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 2.00−2.25, p < 0.00001. In addition, we demonstrated a positive consistent temporal association between circulating BCAA levels and the risk of developing T2DM with differentials in the respective follow-up times of 0−6 years, 6−12 years and ≥12 years follow-up for valine (OR = 2.08, 1.86 and 2.14, p < 0.05 each), leucine (OR = 2.10, 2.25 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) and isoleucine (OR = 2.12, 1.90 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) demonstrated.

In this regard, the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro- and macro-vascular complications. In this article, we have briefly described the role of various causative factors, transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress, a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM. Moreover, the key findings described in this article also provides a new conceptual framework for forthcoming investigations on the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of T2DM and drug discovery.

This is coincident with an overall 33% increase in DM prevalence documented during the last decade. In 1992, type 2 DM was a rare occurrence in most pediatric centers. By 1994, it represented up to 16% of new cases in urban areas, and by 1999, the incidence of new type 2 DM diagnoses ranged between 8% and 45%, depending on geographic location. These patients have been observed primarily in African American, Mexican American, Native American, and Asian American children and youth. As in the adult population, type 2 DM in children and youth occurs as a result of insulin resistance coupled with relative beta-cell failure. While there appears to be a host of potential genetic and environmental risk factors for these aberrations, perhaps the most significant risk factor is obesity. Other risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM, puberty, intrauterine exposure to DM, sedentary lifestyle, female gender, and certain ethnicities. To date, few studies have addressed the role of physical activity and nutrition counseling in improving glycemic outcome, the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular risk, or the most effective treatment regimens for this population. Once type 2 DM is established, the persistence of obesity often interferes with the response to treatment and exacerbates the comorbidities of hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Since fewer than 10% of youth with type 2 DM can be treated with diet and exercise alone, pharmacological intervention is generally required to achieve normoglycemic targets. In most surveys, practitioners prescribe insulin or an oral agent, most often metformin.

Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories.

An update."", ",Jun. 1999,"""Exercise has long been considered a cornerstone in the treatment regimen for patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Aerobic endurance exercise has traditionally been advocated as the most suitable exercise mode. Several exercise studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results obtained have been highly heterogeneous regarding the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control. Only in certain subgroups (e.g. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under 55 years of age, those with diabetes treated through diet and those who have diabetes with fairly good metabolic control), does exercise seem to be beneficial with regard to improvement in glycaemic control. There has been little research into the effects of resistance training on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the amount of research involving aerobic endurance exercise. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with increasing age, partly because of the decline in muscle mass associated with aging. This corresponds with a decline in metabolic function, supporting the usefulness of resistance training. Available studies support the usefulness of resistance training in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, based on the published studies reviewed, this author proposes that an optimal exercise programme for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus should include components that improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, i.e. a combination of aerobic endurance training and circuit-type resistance training. Programmes combining various modes of exercise positively influence patient compliance with the exercise programme. The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can undertake an individualised exercise programme without significantly increased risks of complications.""",,"""National Public Health Institute, Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion, Helsinki, Finland. johan.eriksson@ktl.fi"", "

In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes, and further, to reduce its growing incidence, it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment. Although many factors cause T2DM, this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism. The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness. Nocturnal light exposure, unusual timing of food, irregular sleep/wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock. Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis.

A systemic review and meta-analysis was carried out to elucidate type 2 diabetes mellitus risk in women with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for cohort or case-control studies on the association between hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus. Random-effect model was used to pool risk estimates. Bayesian meta-analysis was carried out to further estimate the type 2 diabetes mellitus risk associated with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy. Seventeen cohort or prospective matched case-control studies were finally included. Those 17 studies involved 2,984,634 women and 46,732 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases. Overall, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy were significantly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 1.56, 95 % confidence interval 1.21-2.01, P = 0.001). Preeclampsia was significantly and independently correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 2.25, 95 % confidence interval 1.73-2.90, P < 0.001). In addition, gestational hypertension was also significantly and independently correlated with subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (relative risk = 2.06, 95 % confidence interval 1.57-2.69, P < 0.001). The pooled estimates were not significantly altered in the subgroup analyses of studies on preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Bayesian meta-analysis showed the relative risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk for individuals with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension were 1.59 (95 % credibility interval: 1.11-2.32), 2.27 (95 % credibility interval: 1.67-2.97), and 2.06 (95 % credibility interval: 1.41-2.84), respectively.

Glycemic control is an important part in management of DM. The first line in treatment of type 2 DM (T2DM) is diet and life style change. Metformin is the first choice of medication in T2DM patients. Sulfonylureas have high risk of hypoglycemia. Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas. Also, α-glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These have no risk for hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner.

In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and a relative beta-cell defect are the underlying pathologic problems leading to hyperglycemia. Notably, insulin resistance is also associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Diabetes can be defined as a disease of accelerated cardiovascular deterioration associated with elevated blood glucose levels. Glycemic control has been shown to reduce the long-term complications associated with diabetes. Although medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed increased physical activity are important components of a diabetes management plan, most patients need medication to lower glucose to near-normal levels. Therapeutic options for treating hyperglycemia include sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. An antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity is an excellent choice for early treatment of type 2 diabetes because it may delay or prevent complications associated with this disease.

The severities of insulin resistance and liver damage parallel each other, with the greatest prevalence of cirrhosis occurring in cirrhotics. However, it is unknown whether one of these conditions causes the other, or if both are consequences of another process. Experimental evidence suggests that both insulin resistance and NAFLD result from a chronic inflammatory state. The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are unknown but might include the egress of products from intestinal bacteria into the portal blood, liver, and systemic circulation to trigger a sustained inflammatory cytokine response in genetically susceptible individuals.

Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed.

In both cases (i.e. chronic hyperglycaemia and CV complications), significant diagnostic and treatment challenges resulting from a broad range of factors may serve as barriers to reducing the deleterious societal impact of T2DM and prediabetes. These challenges often include clinicians: failing to intervene early and aggressively enough among patients with T2DM to achieve CV risk factor control; failing to efficaciously identify T2DM patients with already established CV complications; and failing proactively to assess individuals at high risk for T2DM. This review discusses the apparent symbiosis between CV disease and T2DM, with a focus on identifying patients with established T2DM or at risk for T2DM; traditional and novel risk factors and markers for CV disease in T2DM; challenges related to diagnosing CV disease in T2DM; and organization of T2DM care in order to prevent CV complications. These are issues that require attention because identifying patients at high risk for T2DM can halt or reduce their further glycaemic deterioration if addressed properly, and because novel markers and non-invasive tests could be applied in patients with T2DM as a means of detecting and possibly treating unrecognized CV disease in time. Furthermore, several approaches for T2DM care can be effective in controlling the CV risk factors contributing to CV complications.""",,"""Medical Department, Asker and Baerum Hospital, Rud, Norway. odd.erik.johansen@broadpark.no"", "

Recent experimental and clinical studies show that both disorders are etiologically related to each other through the actions of osteocalcin and adiponectin. Meta-analyses of multiple clinical studies show that hip fracture risk of T2DM patients is increased to 1.4 to 1.7-folds, although BMD of the patients is not diminished. Vertebral fracture risk of T2DM patients is also increased, and BMD is not useful for assessing its risk. These findings suggest that bone fragility in T2DM depends on bone quality deterioration rather than bone mass reduction. Thus, surrogate markers are needed to replace the insensitivity of BMD in assessing fracture risks of T2DM patients. Markers related to advanced glycation end products as well as insulin-like growth factor-I may be such candidates, because these substances were experimentally shown to modulate bone quality in DM. In practice, it is important for physicians to assess fracture risk in T2DM patients by evaluating prior VFs and fracture histories using spine X-ray and interview, respectively, until the usefulness of surrogate markers is established.""",,"""Internal Medicine 1, Shimane University Faculty of Medicine, Japan. yamaguch@med.shimane-u.ac.jp"", "

The mitochondria electron transport chain is a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in insulin secretory cells, insulin peripheral sensitive cells and endothelial cells. Elevated intracellular glucose level induces tricarboxylic acid cycle electron donor overproduction and mitochondrial proton gradient increase leading to an increase in electron transporter lifetime. Subsequently, the electrons leaked combine with respiratory oxygen (O(2)) resulting in superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) production. Advanced glycation end products derive ROS via interaction with their receptors. Elevated diacylglycerol and ROS activate the protein kinase C pathway which, in turn, activates NADPH oxidases. A vicious circle of pathway derived ROS installs. Pathologic pathways induced ROS are activated and persistent though glycemia returns to normal due to hyperglycemia memory. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may produce both superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) and nitric oxide (NO) leading to peroxynitrite ((•)ONOO(-)) generation. Homocysteine is also implicated in oxidative stress pathogenesis. In this paper we have highlighted the pathologic mechanisms of ROS on atherosclerosis, renal dysfunction, retina dysfunction and nerve dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

The metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus, visceral obesity and dyslipidaemia with fatty liver disease being a common associated complication. High-throughput gene expression analyses using GeneChips, microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) have been applied to study global gene expression in insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial and polygenic disease by which several organs are affected. Therefore, the identification of both, disease causing and therapeutically relevant target genes is an ambitious challenge. In the present review we focus on genomic approaches that used biopsies from human skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, the main organs affected by insulin resistance. Members of the PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) family of transcriptional coactivators are decreased in skeletal muscle in insulin resistance accounting for the reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Hepatic steatosis is also linked to alterations in mitochondrial phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism.

In this work we evaluated the relationship between CVD and medication adherence to antihypertensives, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antidepressants among patients with Type 2 DM. We also sought to understand how patients perceived barriers to and facilitators of adherence to medications. Adherence to medications was measured in 72 primary care patients from the West Philadelphia area using electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System caps) over 12 weeks. Standard questions assessed the presence of CVD. Participants answered open-ended questions about barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. Participants who had CVD were significantly less likely to achieve ≥80% adherence to an antidepressant, oral hypoglycemic agent, and antihypertensive medications at 12 weeks. Participants identified four themes related to medication adherence: Interference from Psychosocial Demands, Need for Technological Innovation, Awareness of Disease Severity, and Integrating Community Linkages. Interventions to improve medication adherence among persons with Type 2 DM in underserved communities may aim to address social determinants of health, create community linkages, emphasize disease severity and utilize apps which are integrated with existing primary care services.""","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD ), medication adherence, underserved community, ","""Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Arcadia University, Glenside, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Arcadia University, Glenside, Pennsylvania."", ""Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", "

Women with lesser degrees of glucose intolerance share the same risks. T2DM may occur from postpartum (5 to 14%) to several years later, up to 25 years. Some factors associated with T2DM are identified: obesity, early diagnostic before 24 weeks, high pregnancy OGTT blood glucose or insulinotherapy. Screening for T2DM only with fasting glucose provides less sensibility than with OGTT; HbA1c may supplant these dosages. The recurrence rate of GDM is between 30 and 84%, non-white ethnicity and insulinotherapy during GDM being the best proven predictors. High risk women need repeated life-long screenings for glycemic abnomalies, or when another pregnancy is planned. Among overweight or obese women with history of GDM who show minor glycoregulation disturbances, it is proved that modifications of lifestyle in intensive programs or metformin halve the risk of DT2. However, studies analysing practices show low adhesion to screening; without an intensive program, few women implement lifestyle modifications.

In some of the more common monogenic diabetes types, patients can switch from insulin therapy to sulfonylureas or even discontinue glucose-lowering therapy with stable glycemic control. Advancements in the field have identified tools and resources to aid in distinguishing patients likely to have monogenic diabetes from the more common forms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, genetic testing with accurate interpretation of results is necessary to confirm a diagnosis and direct treatment selection and disease management.

However, in the last 2 decades, it is increasingly being reported in children and adolescents. Obesity is a strong correlate, and the increasing prevalence of obesity and poor physical activity is precipitating type 2 DM at younger ages in the ethnic groups at risk. Indians and other South Asians are among the ethnic groups particularly prone to insulin resistance and type 2 DM, the other racial groups being some American Indian tribes like the Pima Indians, Mexican Americans,Pacific Islanders and African Americans,among others. The WHO has predicted that India will have the greatest number of diabetic individuals in the world by the year 2025. Type 2 DM starting during adolescence puts the individual at risk for major morbidity and even mortality right during the productive years of life. The microvascular complications of DM (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) are brought on at an early age. In addition, type 2 DM and obesity are two components of a metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, the other features of which include hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability of blood. All these conditions together increase the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke). The resulting economic burden will be enormous. Type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome are to a large extent preventable. Adoption of a healthy eating and physical activity pattern has resulted in decreasing the development of DM in a few recent studies from various parts of the world. A concerted,multi-pronged effort is needed, involving the general public, pediatricians and general physicians, teachers and schools, the media,the government and professional medical bodies, to generate a momentum towards the goal of prevention of type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome in the young population of India.""",,"""Department of Endocrinology, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of medical Sciences, lucknow 226 014, Uttar Pardesh, India. vbhatia@sgpgi.ac.in"", "

For the female participants, it was fasting glucose (4th week), triglycerides (6th week), and waist circumference (10th week). Regardless of the gender, fasting glucose was the first to improve significantly, followed by triglycerides. Hypertension did not improve significantly at all in the female participants as they may require more than twelve weeks of therapeutic exercise for any significant improvement in hypertension.""",,"""Department of Physiotherapy, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan 200211, Nigeria."", "

Histopathologic changes in pancreatic islets are also similar to those seen in humans with diabetes. Initially, there is islet hyperplasia with abundant insulin production to compensate for IR, followed by insufficient insulin production with replacement of islets with islet-associated amyloid. Diabetic NHPs also have adverse changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, biomarkers of obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and protein glycation that contribute to the numerous complications of the disease. Furthermore, sex hormones, pregnancy, and environmental factors (e.g., diet and stress) affect IR and can also contribute to diabetes progression in NHPs.

The global epidemic of obesity secondary to physical inactivity and adverse food habits accounts for the alarming rise in NAFLD. Metabolic syndrome plays a major role in the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whilst most cases of NAFLD remain asymptomatic with only hepatic steatosis, about 30 % progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with chronic liver inflammation that can lead on to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the similar pathogenesis shared between T2DM and NAFLD, T2DM occurs as an important complication in many cases of NAFLD, and many cases of T2DM are further complicated by NAFLD. Rapid progression and increased complications of the individual diseases is the end result of this dual coexistence. Diagnosis of NAFLD relies upon hepatic imaging, serum biochemical markers, and liver biopsy. As in T2DM, the most important management option for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle changes targeted at weight reduction. Other treatment options include insulin sensitizers (metformin and pioglitazone), vitamin E, incretin mimetics, omega-3 fatty acids, cholesterol lowering agents, orlistat, and bariatric surgery.

Data from large, prospective studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and the development of T2DM. Smaller, cross-sectional studies also support a relationship between short sleep duration and the development of both insulin resistance and T2DM. Intervention studies show that sleep restriction leads to insulin resistance, with recent sleep extension studies offering tantalising data showing a potential benefit of sleep extension on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. In people with established diabetes the published literature shows an association between poor glucose control and both short and long sleep durations. However, there are currently no studies that determine the causal direction of this relationship, nor whether sleep interventions are likely to offer benefit for people with diabetes to help them achieve tighter glucose control."""," HR hazard ratio,  T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus, Circadian, Clock, Diabetes, Glucose, Insulin resistance, Sleep, ","""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", ""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", ""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", "

Maturity-onset of diabetes of the young, or MODY, is a form of monogenic diabetes that is caused by mutations occurring in a number of different genes. Mutations in different genes tend to cause a slightly different variant of diabetes. MODY is typically diagnosed during late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and is usually observed to develop in adults during their late 50's. One of the main drawbacks in its diagnosis is that many people with MODY are misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a molecular and genetic diagnosis can result in a better treatment and could also help in identifying other family members with MODY.

There is an abundance of evidence that diabetes mellitus play important etiological roles in periodontal diseases. In addition, periodontal diseases have powerful and multiple influences on the occurrence and severity of systemic conditions and diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and pregnancy complications. The relationship of periodontitis and diabetes has been supported by sufficient evidences in the past twenty years: (1) diabetes is an independent risk factor of chronic periodontitis; (2) metabolic control will improve the prognosis of chronic periodontitis; (3) the treatment of chronic periodontitis will improve the metabolic level. Our recent investigation on periodontal status in the families of type 2 diabetes mellitus further confirmed the relationship. It was showed that the periodontal index such as probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and numbers of tooth loss in diabetes family members were significantly higher than non-diabetes family members, while no difference of periodontal parameters was found between well control family members and non diabetes family members. In the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its complications, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its receptors were to be recognized as important factors. The distributions of AGEs and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) are highly consistent in various tissues. One study in our laboratory demonstrated that RAGE was strongly expressed in gingival tissues gathered from T2DM patients with periodontitis compared with systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients, the expression of RAGE was positively correlated with the expression of TNF-alpha, indicating that AGE-RAGE pathway was involved in the development of periodontitis in T2DM patients. It is known that inflammation could induce the prediabetic status characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. However, it is still unclear whether periodontitis is a risk factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus or not. In a current study, the effect of periodontitis on serum levels of lipid and glucose of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients was implied, as the average serum levels of triglycerides and glucose of a large number of AgP patients were both significantly higher than healthy control group, and serum level of total cholesterol in AgP group was positively associated with the percentage of severe attachment loss sites. It seems that periodontitis may alter serum lipid and glucose levels. Furthermore, the effect of periodontitis on diabetes in an animal study has also demonstrated that experimental moderate periodontitis as well as castration could induce insulin resistance and beta cell impairment in rats, and that combination of the two factors would aggravate the degree of insulin resistance (IR). In conclusion, interrelationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been further approved recently.""",,"""Department of Periodontitis, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. kqhxmeng@bjmu.edu.cn"", "

Chronic hyperglycemia is known to be a cause of the development and progression of T2D. As for effective diabetes control, there is strong evidence suggesting that better glycemic control can considerably reduce a risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy. To what values glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be reduced to prevent complications due to T2D, currently remains an urgent problem. Based on the largest studies dealing with this problem, recommendations have been formulated for different groups of patients: to achieve HbA1c levels of < 7% for all patients; < 6% for those at relatively low risk for hypoglycemia, and in the range from 7.5 to 8% for those at its high risk.""",,

Although recent studies suggest that primary prevention of NIDDM is possible, strategies for controlling the NIDDM pandemic remain under development. Successful interventions to date have mainly relied upon the control of obesity and increased exercise, although pharmacological agents are being studied. While a mixture of both high risk and population-based approaches is likely to be required, the former will not prevent new high risk cases developing. Unfortunately, the success in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease through risk factor reduction has not controlled obesity, the most important risk factor for NIDDM. New strategies are currently being developed and focus upon changes in the food supply of whole populations and a community development approach to altering attitudes to food and exercise. As these interventions are in the early stages of their development, formative, process, and quantitative evaluation remain essential components of any community-based programme aimed at the primary prevention of NIDDM.""",,"""South Auckland Academic Division, University of Auckland, Middlemore Hospital, New Zealand."", "

A two-stage qualitative method was selected: First, 250 respondents were questioned using 15-20 minutes half-structured telephone interviews; approximately 40% of the interviewed reported a subjective improvement related to participation in the Curaplan program. In a second step, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 50 of the respondents who had reported a profit from the program. Analyses proceeded in a phenomenon-oriented fashion according to a differentiation and a general psychological-coping perspective. At a differentiation level, eight modes of coping with the illness were reconstructed, for each of which respondents identified a specific improvement. These were: ""Consistent/rational commitment"", ""Discovery-oriented acceptance of challenge"", ""Search for illness-mediated compromise"", ""Anxious quest for increased control"", ""Blinkered denial"", ""Hopelessness"", ""Inability to cope and insecurity"", ""Selfless low prioritization of disease"". At a general level, five central positive dimensions of participation were observed: ""Relationship/not being alone"", ""Meaning/importance"", ""Knowledge/consciousness"", ""Ability to manage/competence gain"", as well as ""Happiness/optimism"". These dimensions complemented and supported one another. The results are not statistically representative but contribute to optimized implementation through psychological understanding of the best cases.

Manifestations of macro- and microvascular complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) often herald the disease in the elderly, yet there is incomplete knowledge of the natural history of the disease and poor guidelines for its effective management in the geriatric population. Once NIDDM is diagnosed in the older patient, the propensity for these patients to develop atherosclerotic vascular complications involving every organ system and the socioeconomic sequela of the disease make treatment prudent. Coexisting risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as dyshypoproteinemia, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking, should be treated vigorously, and poor diet, physical inactivity, and medications affecting glucose tolerance modified. Hyperglycemia resistant to nonpharmacologic therapy should be treated with second-generation oral sulfonylureas, and the judicious use of insulin is advised because of a heightened risk for the hazards of hypoglycemia in the elderly. The treatment of NIDDM has important implications in the elderly because of its prevalence and its association with other age-related pathophysiologic processes. Such effective treatment may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of older people.""",,"""Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland."", "

However, several specificities should be pointed out. Changes associated with ageing may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both sulphonylureas (increasing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia) and biguanides (increasing the risk of lactic acidosis). The best insulin regimen in old age is not known, but a twice-daily injection of a pre-mixed insulin preparation is usually recommended.

Dietary management should not merely be wishful thinking but a reality, involving the control of body weight, the maintenance of lean body mass, the observance of a sufficient carbohydrate intake and the control of protein intake, which, always tends to be excessive in diabetics. Drug treatment with oral antidiabetics may be given without risk of iatrogenic effects: glitazone has no effect on renal metabolism but may increase water retention; glinides are insulin secretagogues without renal metabolism so there is no risk of hypoglycaemia in the event of impaired renal function; if not insulin remains an excellent alternative with, however, a change in its half-life with the elevated creatinine clearance. In all cases, the goal remains the control of glycosylated haemoglobin without iatrogenic effects.""",,"""Service de diabétologie, université Bordeaux-ll, hôpital Sud, 33604 Pessac, France. henri.gin@chu-bordeaux.fr"", "

Compliance with diet and hypoglycemic medication was correlated. The perceived importance, and the ease of compliance were the principal correlates of patient compliance. Factors independently related to diabetic control were compliance with diet, and the quality of the patient's diet. Diabetes which was poorly controlled, and which was of several-years' standing, was more likely to involve complications. Both poor control and the presence of complications contributed to handicap. Increased dietary education and counselling, with emphasis placed on the importance and benefits of compliance with prescribed diets, may improve control, decrease the incidence of complications, and ultimately minimise handicap due to diabetes in non-insulin-dependent patients.""",,
