      "\"Type 2 diabetes is a serious and common chronic disease resulting from a complex inheritance-environment interaction along with other risk factors such as obesity and sedentary lifestyle. Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem, affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially, and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing \"westernization\" or modernization. Multiple risk factors of diabetes, delayed diagnosis until micro- and macro-vascular complications arise, life-threatening complications, failure of the current therapies, and financial costs for the treatment of this disease, make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, the roles of genes, lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The core aims are to bring forward the new therapy strategies and cost-effective intervention trials of type 2 diabetes.\"\n",
      "\"The epidemic of Type 2 diabetes mellitus necessitates development of novel therapeutic and preventative strategies to attenuate expansion of this debilitating disease. Evidence links the circadian system to various aspects of diabetes pathophysiology and treatment. The aim of this review will be to outline the rationale for therapeutic targeting of the circadian system in the treatment and prevention of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and consequent metabolic comorbidities.\"\n",
      "\"Genetic, environmental, and metabolic risk factors are interrelated and contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A strong family history of diabetes mellitus, age, obesity, and physical inactivity identify those individuals at highest risk. Minority populations are also at higher risk, not only because of family history and genetics, but also because of adaptation to American environmental influences of poor dietary and exercise habits. Women with a history of gestational diabetes as well as their children are at greater risk for progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance increases a person's risk for developing impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. Individuals who have insulin resistance share many of the same risk factors as those with type 2 diabetes. These include hyperinsulinemia, atherogenic dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension, prothrombic state, hyperuricemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Current interventions for the prevention and retardation of type 2 diabetes mellitus are those targeted towards modifying environmental risk factors such as reducing obesity and promoting physical activity. Awareness of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes will promote screening, early detection, and treatment in high-risk populations with the goal of decreasing both microvascular and macrovascular complications.\"\n",
      "\"This review article explores scientists' current understanding of type 2 diabetes as a complex disorder that involves not just the pancreas and insulin system but also the liver, kidneys, gut, muscle, fat cells, and even the brain. An appreciation of the complex pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes allows the primary care practitioner to best manage patients with this common and serious disorder.\"\n",
      "\"The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications go along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.\"\n",
      "\"The global prevalence of diabetes has risen in adults from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in 2014. 90-95% of adults with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes (T2D). This paper focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and excess fatty acids increase oxidative stress, disrupt protein kinase C signaling and increase advanced glycation end-products that result in vascular inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and atherogenesis. Intensive T2D treatment produces a ≥10% risk reduction in major macrovascular and microvascular events. Glucose-lowering therapies must be individualized. Metformin is an optimal drug for monotherapy. If hemoglobin A1c is not at goal, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor should be considered for therapy with metformin. Coronary angioplasty/stenting is recommended for diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarctions. Coronary artery bypass grafting is recommended for symptomatic diabetic patients with multivessel disease.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is strongly associated with lower performance on multiple domains of cognitive function and with structural abnormalities of the brain. With the growing epidemic of diabetes and aging population, neural complications of diabetes are expected to rise and becoming a challenge for future health implications. Understanding pathophysiology, factors associated with this complication, manifestation of cognitive impairment and various metabolic and neuroradiologic markers suggestive of this pathologic condition is crucial for proper management of this potentially debilitating complication of T2DM. This review will discuss briefly important aspects of cognitive impairment in T2DM.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common clinical chronic disease, while its pathogenesis is still inconclusive. Intestinal flora, the largest micro-ecological system in the human body, is involved in, meanwhile has a major impact on the body's material and energy metabolism. Recent studies have shown that in addition to obesity, genetics, and islet dysfunction, the disturbance of intestinal flora may partly give rise to diabetes. In this paper, we summarized the current research on the correlation between T2DM and intestinal flora, and concluded the pathological mechanisms of intestinal flora involved in T2DM. Moreover, the ideas and methods of prevention and treatment of T2DM based on intestinal flora were proposed, providing theoretical basis and literature reference for the treatment of T2DM and its complications based on the regulation of intestinal flora.\"\n",
      "\"The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents is increasing, mirroring the epidemic of paediatric obesity. Early-onset T2DM is associated with poor long-term outcomes.\"\n",
      "\"The study of type 2 diabetes has been driven by advances in human genetics, epigenetics, biomarkers, mechanistic studies, and large clinical trials, enabling new insights into disease susceptibility, pathophysiology, progression, and development of complications. Simultaneously, several new drug classes with different mechanisms of action have been introduced over the past two decades, accompanied by data about cardiovascular safety and non-glycaemic outcomes. In this Review, we critically examine the progress and integration of this new science into clinical practice, and review opportunities for enabling the use of precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes. We contrast the success in delivering personalised medicine for monogenic diabetes with the greater challenge of providing a precision medicine approach for type 2 diabetes, highlighting gaps, limitations, and areas requiring further study.\"\n",
      "\"Epidemiological studies have implied that diabetes mellitus (DM) will become an epidemic accompany with metabolic and endocrine disorders worldwide. Most of DM patients are affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with insulin resistance and insulin secretion defect. Generally, the strategies to treat T2DM are diet control, moderate exercise, hypoglycemic and lipid-lowing agents. Despite the therapeutic benefits for the treatment of T2DM, most of the drugs can produce some undesirable side effects. Considering the pathogenesis of T2DM, natural products (NPs) have become the important resources of bioactive agents for anti-T2DM drug discovery. Recently, more and more natural components have been elucidated to possess anti-T2DM properties, and many efforts have been carried out to elucidate the possible mechanisms. The aim of this paper was to overview the activities and underlying mechanisms of NPs against T2DM. Developments of anti-T2DM agents will be greatly promoted with the increasing comprehensions of NPs for their multiple regulating effects on various targets and signal pathways.\"\n",
      "\"There is currently no reported staging system for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Here, I attempted to stage type 2 diabetes mellitus in order to help clinicians, patients, and other interested individuals to effectively evaluate patient conditions.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex, chronic metabolic disease, presents a heterogeneous etiology, with risk factors at the social level and behavioral, environmental, and genetic susceptibility. It is associated with serious complications, but the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy may prevent or delay the onset of long-term complications. In children and adolescents, it was observed in particular increasing the prevalence of T2DM along with obesity, which is associated with insulin resistance. Patient and family education for a young person with T2DM is very important and will focus on behavioral changes (diet and activity).\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes can cause blindness, kidney failure and peripheral neuropathy, and is associated with premature death. Mary MacKinnon reviews this complex major disease and describes new treatments that are due to be licensed in the UK in the coming year.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the common endocrinology diseases that greatly affects the health care sector and economy. Application of hypoglycemic drugs has its own drawbacks and the use of non-drug therapy on treating T2DM has drawn much attention recently. This paper reviewed the research development of the non-pharmacological interventions on T2DM in recent years, including dietary therapy, exercise therapy, psychotherapy, acupuncture and moxibustion therapies and so on. The authors mentioned the problems in the research of non-drug treatment for blood glucose control of T2DM and put forward new ideas for the research in the future. Further well-designed trials with large sample size and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm current conclusions.\"\n",
      "\"Background Affordable interventions to improve metabolic control of Type 2-Diabetes Mellitus are increasingly necessary. Aim To review systematically the existing literature on the effects of psychological interventions on Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus compensation. Material and Methods We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of psychological interventions implemented for Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. Research included the following electronic databases: PubMed, Bireme, Web of Science, SciELO, Embase, EBSCOhost, SCOPUS, Psychology Database. Results Most studies showed a decrease in the level of glycated hemoglobin after interventions, which applied different initiatives complementary to standard medical treatment. Mainly, these interventions encompassed training for self-monitoring and control of diabetes based on cognitive behavioral psychology, counseling, self-assessment and physical-spiritual work based on transpersonal psychology. Conclusions Psychological tools could be an adjunct to the standard medical treatment for patients with Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus, reducing glycated hemoglobin levels and improving self-regulation, disease awareness and adherence from the self-efficacy perception perspective.\"\n",
      "\"Diabetes along with related comorbidities associated with high disability rates severely threatens human health. The etiology of diabetes is complex. Genetics, environmental factors, eating habits, drug usage, aging, and lack of movement play important roles in the development of diabetes. Intestinal flora is reportedly closely related to the occurrence and development of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we review changes in abundance and proportion of intestinal flora in patients with type 2 diabetes and regulation of intestinal flora through diet, drugs, and surgery to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes. A more appropriate clinical diagnosis and treatment plan could be made considering changes in intestinal flora in the future.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) prevalence has significantly increased worldwide in recent years due to population age, obesity, and modern sedentary lifestyles. The projections estimate that 439 million people will be diabetic in 2030. T2DM is characterized by an impaired β-pancreatic cell function and insulin secretion, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and recently the epigenetic regulation of β-pancreatic cells differentiation has been underlined as being involved. It is currently known that several bioactive molecules, widely abundant in plants used as food or infusions, have a key role in histone modification and DNA methylation, and constituted potential epidrugs candidates against T2DM. In this sense, in this review the epigenetic mechanisms involved in T2DM and protein targets are reviewed, with special focus in studies addressing the potential use of phytochemicals as epidrugs that prevent and/or control T2DM in vivo and in vitro. As main findings, and although some controversial results have been found, bioactive molecules with epigenetic regulatory function, appear to be a potential replacement/complementary therapy of pharmacological hypoglycemic drugs, with minimal side effects. Indeed, natural epidrugs have shown to prevent or delay the T2DM development and the morbidity associated to dysfunction of blood vessels, eyes and kidneys due to sustained hyperglycemia in T2DM patients.\"\n",
      "\"A low carbohydrate diet (LCD), with some staple food being replaced with nuts, has been shown to reduce weight, improve blood glucose, and regulate blood lipid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM. However, more studies are required to fully establish the effect of almond on the improvement of HbA1c.\"\n",
      "\"Diabetes influences other chronic medical conditions and is influenced by each in turn through multifactorial pathways. These comorbid conditions have a direct relationship with diabetes and can increase the severity of diabetes and the risk of various complications. Each of these comorbidities has unique recommendations for pharmaceutical treatment. However, guidelines for all of these comorbidities also include lifestyle interventions as first-line treatment. Recent research has shown that diabetic medications may play a direct role in treating some of these comorbidities. This article focuses on the best-known comorbid diseases associated specifically with type 2 diabetes and their co-management.\"\n",
      "\"The development of type 2 diabetes is usually associated with a combination of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in various insulin target tissues such as the liver, muscle and adipocytes. Normal β-cells can compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion or β-cell mass, but insufficient compensation leads to the onset of glucose intolerance. Once hyperglycemia becomes apparent, β-cell function gradually deteriorates and insulin resistance aggravates. This process is called \"glucose toxicity\".\"\n",
      "\"The mortality rate of patients with schizophrenia is high, and life expectancy is shorter by 10 to 20 years. Metabolic abnormalities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the main reasons. The prevalence of T2DM in patients with schizophrenia may be epidemiologically frequent because antipsychotics induce weight gain as a side effect and the cognitive dysfunction of patients with schizophrenia relates to a disordered lifestyle, poor diet, and low socioeconomic status. Apart from these common risk factors and risk factors unique to schizophrenia, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of common susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and T2DM. Functional proteins translated from common genetic susceptibility genes are known to regulate neuronal development in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through several common cascades. In this review, we discuss common susceptibility genes, functional cascades, and the relationship between schizophrenia and T2DM. Many genetic and epidemiological studies have reliably associated the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2DM, and it is probably safe to think that common cascades and mechanisms suspected from common genes' functions are related to the onset of both schizophrenia and T2DM. On the other hand, even when genetic analyses are performed on a relatively large number of comorbid patients, the results are sometimes inconsistent, and susceptibility genes may carry only a low or moderate risk. We anticipate future directions in this field.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in older adults (≥65 years of age) and increases fall risk. Fear of falling and low balance confidence are reported in both fallers and nonfallers and can potentially be more debilitating than a fall itself. Therefore, the objective of this scoping review was to examine and map the current research evidence of balance confidence and fear of falling in older adults with type 2 diabetes. A search of CINAHL, EMBASE and PubMed was conducted. The search included MeSH terms and the key terms diabet* AND fear OR falls AND self-efficacy OR balance confidence. Inclusion criteria were 1) population: older adults (≥65 years of age) with type 2 diabetes; and 2) outcome measure: balance confidence or fear of falling. We included 21 studies: fear of falling (n=14); balance confidence (n=7). We categorized them into 4 themes: prevalence, severity, determinants and interventions. Determinants were further categorized into physical, psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions (e.g. gait and balance training, tai chi, yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence. Future work is needed to generate best practices related to fear of falling and low balance confidence in older adults with type 2 diabetes.\"\n",
      "\"About 1 in 10 adults worldwide are estimated to have diabetes mellitus. They are at risk of developing life-threatening complications resulting in reduced quality of life, increased mortality and higher healthcare costs. The ability to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by modifying some of its risk factors has been hypothesized for decades. The long and often gradual time-course of increasing dysglycemia prior to diabetes diagnosis suggests that interventions during that period could be effective in preventing T2DM. In addition to lifestyle modifications, certain drugs prevent or slow development of hyperglycemia. Recently, drugs used for obesity management were shown to prevent T2DM. In this review, we discuss various pharmacotherapeutic options for preventing T2DM.\"\n",
      "\"Introduction: Recent studies have concluded that elevated circulating branched chain amino acids (BCAA) are associated with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. However, the development of this association over time and the quantification of the strength of this association for individual BCAAs prior to T2DM diagnosis remains unexplored. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the Healthcare Databases Advance Search (HDAS) via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. The data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for all papers from inception until November 2021. Nine studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Stratification was based on follow-up times (0−6, 6−12 and 12 or more years) and controlling of body mass index (BMI) through the specific assessment of overweight cohorts was also undertaken. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between BCAA concentrations and the development of T2DM, with valine OR = 2.08 (95% CI = 2.04−2.12, p < 0.00001), leucine OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.76−2.87, p < 0.00001) and isoleucine OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 2.00−2.25, p < 0.00001. In addition, we demonstrated a positive consistent temporal association between circulating BCAA levels and the risk of developing T2DM with differentials in the respective follow-up times of 0−6 years, 6−12 years and ≥12 years follow-up for valine (OR = 2.08, 1.86 and 2.14, p < 0.05 each), leucine (OR = 2.10, 2.25 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) and isoleucine (OR = 2.12, 1.90 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) demonstrated. Conclusion: Plasma BCAA concentrations are associated with T2DM incidence across all temporal subgroups. We suggest the potential utility of BCAAs as an early biomarker for T2DM irrespective of follow-up time.\"\n",
      "\"China is gradually taking its place as one of the world's economic giants and concurrently learning to cope with the burden of diseases that are more common in the developed world, such as paediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been recently observed among children and adolescents in China; hence, there is a lack of information about the incidence, prevalence, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of the disease. Diagnosis, treatment, and management have been standardized to a large degree, but there is still a need for data regarding optimal management protocols and how to achieve the best control over current state of the disease. The objective of this review is to consolidate the available information about paediatric diabetes, with a focus on the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Chinese youth. Here we emphasize the prevention strategies and have included literature with respect to pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment published in English and Chinese within the past 10 years.\"\n",
      "\"The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to skyrocket across the industrialized world leading to soaring medical costs, reduced quality of life and increased mortality rates. Therefore, a more firm understanding of the development of the disease and effective, low cost therapies for prevention and treatment are desperately needed. Accumulating evidence suggests that increased sedentary time (i.e. 'sitting time') combined with reduced physical activity levels, plays both a major role in the development of T2D and may contribute to the worsening of the condition after diagnosis. In this review, we cover these topics and use current scientific evidence to support our belief that 'type 2 diabetes sits in a chair'. We also discuss a relatively new question that has yet to be examined: Would reducing sitting time be an effective treatment for T2D?\"\n",
      "\"Oxidative stress has been considered as a major hallmark for the pathogenesis and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but still it is debatable whether it is a mere aggregation of inflammatory-induced responses or clinical entity that underlies with various pathophysiological factors. In this regard, the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro- and macro-vascular complications. In this article, we have briefly described the role of various causative factors, transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress, a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM. Moreover, the key findings described in this article also provides a new conceptual framework for forthcoming investigations on the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of T2DM and drug discovery.

Understanding and applying the knowledge of these differences in clinical practice is essential to assist women with T2DM so as to improve their diabetes self-management, function, quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Of course, as with men, prevention of diabetes remains an important management objective.\"\n",
      "\"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing in children and is reaching epidemic proportions in some western countries. Sue Howdle and Terry Wilkin examine the extent of the problem, the disease process, screening, prevention and management of type 2 diabetes.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric population is now a public health problem. It represents 8 to 45% of all diabetes reported among children and adolescents. Concurrently, childhood obesity has become an epidemic in the United States. Epidemiologic risk factors and diagnostic criteria have largely been established: The incidence of type 2 diabetes increases with age and obesity. Children and adolescents diagnosed with type 2 diabetes usually have a first- or second-degree relative with the disorder. Familial clustering and twin studies have suggested a genetic component for type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms that promote diabetes in susceptible individuals, the best treatment plans, and methods of prevention of this disorder are not yet established.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus, a significant cause of adult morbidity and mortality, is being diagnosed more frequently in children and adolescents. Genetic predisposition and environmental factors are important determinants for the expression of this disease. Blacks, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans are known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus as adults and there appears to be increased prevalence of the disease in adolescent members of these groups. Obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and high-fat diet are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A combination of peripheral insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency results in chronic hyperglycemia. The onset of hyperglycemia is usually slow and symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia are often subtle and may go unrecognized by the patient. The treatment of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus is an area of active study. Programs targeting diet modification and increased physical activity are being developed in hopes of delaying or preventing the onset of disease. This paper examines risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, reviews diagnostic criteria, and discusses newly established screening criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.\"\n",
      "\"While diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 used to be distinguished largely by age at onset, in the past decade there has been an increase in the number of children presenting with diabetes that can be controlled with oral medications. This has lead to these children being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite their young age. This chapter offers an overview of presenting features, pathophysiology, treatment and prognosis of this disorder in the adolescent patient. Additionally, it offers information regarding the relationship between increasing childhood obesity and a rise in the reported cases of diabetes in children. Appropriate screening and laboratory tests and their results are explained, and the pros and cons of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies are discussed. Some complications of diabetes in the developing adolescent differ from those adults will face, and the well-known complications of diabetes (hyperlipidemia, hypertension) must be addressed in a population that is not normally screened for these health concerns. It is hoped that by educating physicians to the potential for this disorder in their adolescent patients, long-term complications can be reduced and advanced sequelae of vascular and neurologic problems can possibly be avoided altogether.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has been described as a new epidemic affecting the American pediatric population. This is coincident with an overall 33% increase in DM prevalence documented during the last decade. In 1992, type 2 DM was a rare occurrence in most pediatric centers. By 1994, it represented up to 16% of new cases in urban areas, and by 1999, the incidence of new type 2 DM diagnoses ranged between 8% and 45%, depending on geographic location. These patients have been observed primarily in African American, Mexican American, Native American, and Asian American children and youth. As in the adult population, type 2 DM in children and youth occurs as a result of insulin resistance coupled with relative beta-cell failure. While there appears to be a host of potential genetic and environmental risk factors for these aberrations, perhaps the most significant risk factor is obesity. Other risk factors include a family history of type 2 DM, puberty, intrauterine exposure to DM, sedentary lifestyle, female gender, and certain ethnicities. To date, few studies have addressed the role of physical activity and nutrition counseling in improving glycemic outcome, the most effective ways to reduce cardiovascular risk, or the most effective treatment regimens for this population. Once type 2 DM is established, the persistence of obesity often interferes with the response to treatment and exacerbates the comorbidities of hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Since fewer than 10% of youth with type 2 DM can be treated with diet and exercise alone, pharmacological intervention is generally required to achieve normoglycemic targets. In most surveys, practitioners prescribe insulin or an oral agent, most often metformin. Specific treatment algorithms for pediatric patients with type 2 DM need to be rigorously investigated.\"\n",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among men and women, although women are usually underdiagnosed and experience a delay in diagnosis. This also occurs in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, despite the fact that diabetes is recognized as a major cardiovascular risk factor. Several factors influence the gap between diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease in women: lack of perception of cardiovascular risk, effects of sex-related risk factors and the action of drugs in women. Women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are more likely to be assigned a lower CVD risk category and to receive lifestyle counseling as well as less intensive CVD therapy compared with men. The present narrative review aims to analyze the risk of CVD in women with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and whether there is a difference between men and women in the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors, new hypoglycemic drugs.\"\n",

Growing evidence suggest that type 2 diabetes and depression share biological mechanisms. This brief commentary discusses current understanding of shared biological pathways, focussing on hyperglycaemia, (micro)vascular dysfunction, and low-grade inflammation. Although there is accumulating evidence that these pathways are involved in the link between type 2 diabetes and depression, direct evidence of their temporal associations is lacking because of a paucity of longitudinal studies that focus on the pathobiology of both type 2 diabetes and depression.\"\n",

      "\"Prediabetes has developed into a global pandemic, its prevalence increasing year by year. Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.\"\n",

Metabolomics is an emerging molecular approach that helps better understand the etiology and promises the identification of novel biomarkers for complex diseases. Both targeted or untargeted metabolites extracted from cells, biofluids, or tissues can be investigated by established high-throughput platforms, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Metabolomics is proposed as a valuable tool in precision diabetes medicine to discover biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the progress of diabetes through personalized phenotyping and individualized drug-response monitoring.

Health care planning together with the commitment of policy makers has been a critical factor in this reduction. However, with rapid social and economic growth, lifestyle-related non communicable diseases have emerged as new health challenges to the country. Diabetes and obesity are leading risks posed by the chronic diseases. The burden of diabetes has increased sharply in Oman over the last decade, rising from 8.3% in 1991 to 11.6% in 2000 among adults aged 20 years and older. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicted an increase of 190% in the number of subjects living with diabetes in Oman over the next 20 years, rising from 75,000 in 2000 to 217,000 in 2025. There is a lack of awareness of the major risk factors for diabetes mellitus in the Omani population generally. As education is often the most significant predictor of knowledge regarding risk factors, complications and the prevention of diabetes, health promotion in Oman is deemed critical, along with other prevention and control measures. Suitable prevention strategies for reducing the prevalence of diabetes in Oman are discussed. Recommendations are made for reforms in the current health care system; otherwise, diabetes will constitute a major drain on Oman's human and financial resources, threatening the advances in health and longevity achieved over the past decades.\"\n",

The growing burden of these two conditions and their impact on health of the individual and on society in general needs urgent attention from the health care professionals. Availability of multiple treatment choices for managing T2DM and HF may make therapeutic decisions more complex for clinicians. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials of antidiabetic drugs have added very robust evidence to effectively manage subjects with this dual condition. This consensus statement provides the prevalence trends and the impact of this dual burden on patients. In addition, it concisely narrates the types of HF, the different treatment algorithms, and recommendations for physicians to comprehensively manage such patients.\"\n",
      "\"As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide, there is an enhanced need for effective disease management. Type 2 diabetes is managed through a stepwise program of intensive therapy that consists of lifestyle modifications and sequential addition of oral antihyperglycemic agents and insulin as necessary. Successful implementation of this approach lessens the microvascular complications of the disease and promotes a lifestyle that may reduce macrovascular complications and comorbidities. Because of the progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure that causes hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, many people with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require insulin for disease management. Insulin may be used alone or in combination with oral agents to achieve glycemic control with a minimum of side effects. Although disease management regimens must be tailored to the needs of the individual with type 2 diabetes, the health care provider should always employ an aggressive, treat-to-target strategy to lower hyperglycemia and lessen diabetes-related risk factors.\"\n",

Besides the conventional anti-diabetic drugs, integrated medicinal approach for treating diabetes type 2 with a compact therapeutic approach consisting of various targeted treatments for individual symptoms associated with the disease are being tried currently. Diabetes associated complications like high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, microalbumuria, dyslipidemia, pro -coagulation, etc. are being targeted and dealt with individually in the integrative medicinal approach.

      "\"The epidemic of overweight and obesity is a major driver of the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus globally. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as body mass index rises above 25 kg/m(2). Obesity currently costs the Canadian economy approximately $7.1 billion annually whereas per capita health care cost for individuals with diabetes are 3 to 4 times that for persons without the disease. Each kilogram of weight lost through health behaviour changes in people with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a relative diabetes risk reduction of 16%. As 80% to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and adiposity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes, weight loss is recommended as the cornerstone management measure. A modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is an achievable and realistic goal for preventing type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals and improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with type 2 diabetes. When health behaviour modification fails to achieve glycemic and metabolic goal targets, priority should be given to antihyperglycemic agents that are associated with weight loss or weight neutrality. Every pound of body fat loss matters and every kilogram counts in the management of type 2 diabetes.\"\n",

This paper reviews the wide pathophysiological problems associated with Type 2 diabetes and discusses the benefits of exercise therapy on phenotype characteristics, glycemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in Type 2 diabetes patients. Based on the currently available literature, it is concluded that Type 2 diabetes patients should be stimulated to participate in specifically designed exercise intervention programs. More attention should be paid to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning as well as motivational factors to improve long-term treatment adherence and clinical efficacy. More clinical research is warranted to establish the efficacy of exercise intervention in a more differentiated approach for Type 2 diabetes subpopulations within different stages of the disease and various levels of co-morbidity.\"\n",
      "\"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in youth has increased dramatically over the past decades. The literature also suggests that the progression from an impaired glucose tolerance state to established T2DM is more rapid in youth, compared to adults. The presence of significant cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM, including cardiac, macrovascular, and microvascular remodeling, is another major issue in this younger cohort and poses a significant threat to the healthcare system. However, this issue is only now emerging as a major public health concern, with few data to support optimal treatment targets and strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in youth with T2DM. Accordingly, the purpose of this minireview is to better understand the cardiovascular complications in youth with T2DM. We briefly describe the pathophysiology from youth studies, including oxidative stress, inflammation, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, and epigenetics, which link T2DM and CVD. We also describe the literature concerning the early signs of CVD in youth and potential treatment options to reduce cardiovascular risk.\"\n",
      "\"Exercise has long been considered a cornerstone in the treatment regimen for patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Aerobic endurance exercise has traditionally been advocated as the most suitable exercise mode. Several exercise studies have evaluated the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the results obtained have been highly heterogeneous regarding the effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control. Only in certain subgroups (e.g. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under 55 years of age, those with diabetes treated through diet and those who have diabetes with fairly good metabolic control), does exercise seem to be beneficial with regard to improvement in glycaemic control. There has been little research into the effects of resistance training on glucose metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with the amount of research involving aerobic endurance exercise. The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases with increasing age, partly because of the decline in muscle mass associated with aging. This corresponds with a decline in metabolic function, supporting the usefulness of resistance training. Available studies support the usefulness of resistance training in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, based on the published studies reviewed, this author proposes that an optimal exercise programme for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus should include components that improve cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance, i.e. a combination of aerobic endurance training and circuit-type resistance training. Programmes combining various modes of exercise positively influence patient compliance with the exercise programme. The vast majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can undertake an individualised exercise programme without significantly increased risks of complications.\"\n",
      "\"Few Type 2 diabetes loci are considered confirmed and replicated across multiple populations. Some genes that have become accepted as contributors to diabetes risk include: calpain 10, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, ATP-sensitive inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha and hepatic transcription factor 1. While numerous reports of new diabetes loci enter the literature on a regular basis, this review focuses on selected novel associations reported within the last 12 months. In particular, we highlight recent reports of associations between Type 2 diabetes and the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene, associations with micro-opioid receptor and supressor of cytokine signaling 2 genes, and expression and functional analyses of adipokines vaspin and retinol binding protein 4. These new results provide insights into possible mechanisms influencing disease susceptibility and thus new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for Type 2 diabetes.\"\n",
      "\"The circadian clock drives a number of metabolic processes including energy intake, storage and utilization coupled with the sleep/wake cycles. Globally, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has become a significant international public health concern. In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes, and further, to reduce its growing incidence, it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment. Although many factors cause T2DM, this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism. The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness. Nocturnal light exposure, unusual timing of food, irregular sleep/wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock. Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis. This strategy thus represents a chronotherapeutic option for non-pharmaceutical intervention in treating T2DM patients.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered an exclusive disease of adulthood until the late 1970s, when reports of an increased prevalence in the pediatric age group emerged in the literature. The concerning upswing in the rate of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents has continued, parallel to the increasing rates of obesity. The disease is not specific to the U.S.; it has proven to be a global problem. The current information on type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents is mostly extrapolated from studies in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, due to the paucity of studies conducted in youth. Obesity, family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, minority ethnicity and race, polycystic ovary syndrome, maternal diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance during gestation, and acanthosis nigricans are the major risk factors and markers of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiology, which involves both an insulin secretion defect and resistance to insulin, needs further clarification in pediatric studies. Current management approaches involve lifestyle modification (nutritional and exercise) along with pharmacologic agents, such as insulin and oral antihyperglycemic medications, as indicated. A recent study on the use of metformin in childhood-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus demonstrated the drug to be effective and to have a good safety profile in this population. However, the outcomes of ongoing studies and future studies focusing on type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group will be crucial in terms of fine-tuning management plans and setting up appropriate prevention strategies.\"\n",
      "\"Both Type 1 [T1DM] and Type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM] share a nexus with altered thyroid status. In recent times, evidences point to the link between thyroid hormones andT2DM in particular. Several lines of evidences suggest an array of biochemical and molecular events. Gene polymorphism, disturbances in gene expression and regulation, enhanced and bizarre absorption of dietary glucose from intestine, decreased utilization of glucose by tissues and aberrations in hepatic handling of glucose with the onus on Gluconeogenesis are some of the projected mechanisms. Insulin resistance, a progressive condition is the hallmark in T2DM. Hypothyroidism as well as hyperthyroidism have been associated with insulin resistance which are synonymous with impaired glucose metabolism in T2DM. A multitude of basic, clinical and molecular studies provide an insight into thyroid comorbidity in T2DM, though there are a few instances to suggest equivocal link denoting cause-effect relationship. In biochemical pharmacology, as fortified by pharmacogenomics, modalities have now been proposed, through drug trials, to underline the utility of specifically designed thyroid hormone analogues in addressing metabolic syndrome, DM and associated cardiovascular pathology. A thorough understanding of the physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms would certainly open newer vistas in the perspectives of T2DM with special reference to alterations in thyroid status.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (formerly called non-insulin-dependent diabetes) causes abnormal carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Insulin resistance is a major contributor to progression of the disease and to complications of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a common and underdiagnosed condition that poses treatment challenges to family practitioners. The introduction of new oral agents within the past three years has expanded the range of possible combination regimens available for treating type 2 diabetes. Despite the choice of pharmacologic agents, physicians must stress the nonpharmacologic approaches of diet modification, weight control and regular exercise. Pharmacologic approaches must be based on patient characteristics, level of glucose control and cost considerations. Combinations of different oral agents may be useful for controlling hyperglycemia before insulin therapy becomes necessary. A stepped-care approach to drug therapy may provide the most rational, cost-efficient approach to management of this disease. Pharmaco-economic analyses of clinical trials are needed to determine cost-effective treatment strategies for management of type 2 diabetes.\"\n",

In multiple studies, family functioning, a family systems variable, has been correlated with self-management and glycemic outcomes. Most persons with diabetes live with family members who might facilitate or inhibit self-management tasks or skills. Multiple afflictions of family members with diabetes can further complicate matters relating to diabetes self-management. Diabetes collectively affects over 16 million people in the USA, incurring healthcare costs in excess of 92 billion dollars annually. Individuals engage in self-management behavior for diabetes care in the context of their family's environment. It is imperative that nurses consider factors that might inhibit or facilitate self-management efforts by individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Assessment of family determinants of adaptation to diabetes with appropriate interventions can improve clinical outcomes, subsequently preventing complications.\"\n",
      "\"Dyslipidemia is the most fundamental risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In clinical practice, many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient's lipid profile and, potentially, the risk for ASCVD-either favorably or unfavorably. The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, in terms of unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several factors, most notably insulin resistance, associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce levels of atherogenic cholesterol particles and thus the patient's absolute risk.\"\n",

Despite recent therapeutic drug trials, metformin and insulin are the only medicines currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth. Because of recently amended pharmaceutical regulations, however, it is likely that more antidiabetic medications soon will be added to the armamentarium of therapeutic options for youth with type 2 diabetes.

Glinides are associated with lower risk of hypoglycemia in comparison to sulfonylureas. Also, α-glucosidase inhibitors decrease the polysaccharides' digestion in small intestine and are less effective in comparison to metformin and sulfonylureas in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). These have no risk for hypoglycemia, but gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner. Therefore, these are associated with no risk of hypoglycemia. Pramlintide is an amylin agonist which is also effective in lowering postprandial blood glucose. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and have no risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was confirmed by diagnosis codes. Comorbidities were identified using diagnosis codes, clinical measurements, and/or medication use.Results: A total of 1,522,526 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were included in the analysis, 25% of whom had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, hyperlipidemia, overweight/obesity, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and neuropathy. These were present, respectively, in the following percentages of patients with and without cardiovascular disease: 98.3 and 91.0%, 94.8 and 78.5%, 80.5 and 80.6%, 38.5 and 18.9, 20.2, and 4.3%, and 13.7 and 8.6%. Thus, the frequencies of hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure were notably higher in patients with cardiovascular disease.

      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Cardiometabolic risk factors, including hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, increased visceral fat and inflammation, are associated with increased risk in this population and represent potential targets for treatment. In this review, management strategies for patients with T2DM post-ACS, both in the acute-care setting and in the long-term, are discussed. Although the benefits of long-term, aggressive, multifactorial risk factor modification are well established, a significant burden of recurrent events remains and the search for novel strategies continues. Several studies are assessing the potential cardiovascular (CV) benefits and safety of various classes of newer agents. Of these, AleCardio (aleglitazar), Examination of Cardiovascular Outcomes With Alogliptin versus Standard of Care in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Acute Coronary Syndrome (EXAMINE; alogliptin) and Evaluation of LIXisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ELIXA; lixisenatide) specifically address patients with type 2 diabetes post-ACS. The mechanisms of action of these new therapies and aims of the CV outcome studies are briefly reviewed. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide highlighting the need for new strategies that address the complex underlying processes that drive atherosclerosis and CV events in this high-risk patient population.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) is a chronic disease characterised by variable degrees of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Besides, several pieces of evidence have shown that chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70) are strongly involved in DM2 and its complications, and various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment alternatives act in these processes/molecules to modulate them and ameliorate the disease. Besides, uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is related to several complications as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy and hepatic, renal and cardiac complications. In this review, we address discuss the involvement of different inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways related to DM2, and we described molecular targets modulated by therapeutics currently available to treat DM2.\"\n",

      "\"Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 17 million adults in the United States and has profound implications in terms of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications and their associated costs. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and a relative beta-cell defect are the underlying pathologic problems leading to hyperglycemia. Notably, insulin resistance is also associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Diabetes can be defined as a disease of accelerated cardiovascular deterioration associated with elevated blood glucose levels. Glycemic control has been shown to reduce the long-term complications associated with diabetes. Although medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed increased physical activity are important components of a diabetes management plan, most patients need medication to lower glucose to near-normal levels. Therapeutic options for treating hyperglycemia include sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and insulin. An antidiabetic agent that improves insulin sensitivity is an excellent choice for early treatment of type 2 diabetes because it may delay or prevent complications associated with this disease. Because of the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, aggressive intervention early in the course of the disease, including combination therapy, is often necessary.\"\n",
      "\"Diabetes mellitus is among the most serious, costly, and in some cases, preventable health care problem in the United States today. Primary care providers such as nurse practitioners are ideally suited to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and provide counseling and interventions regarding intensive management (i.e., medications, nutrition, and exercise), prevention of complications, immunizations, laboratory screenings, and physical examinations. This article provides a general overview of type 2 diabetes and the role of the nurse practitioner in the prevention and management of this disorder.\"\n",

Youth with T2DM are most often obese, have a parent or other first-degree relative with T2DM, and are of low socioeconomic status. To understand the complex set of interrelated psychological and social influences that affect the well-being of youth with T2DM, levels of influence from determinants of genetics, family, and community/societal and minority ethnic groups must be included.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chief concern for patients, healthcare providers, and health care systems in America, and around the globe. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety more frequently than people without diabetes. Anxiety is traditionally associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased medical complications among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Collaborative care models have been utilized in the multidisciplinary treatment of mental health problems and chronic disease, and have demonstrated success in managing the pathology of depression which often accompanies diabetes. However, no specific treatment model has been published that links the treatment of anxiety to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the success of collaborative care models in treating depression associated with diabetes, and anxiety unrelated to chronic disease, it is possible that the collaborative care treatment of primary care patients who suffer from both anxiety and diabetes could be met with the same success. The key issue is determining how to implement and sustain these models in practice. This review summarizes the proposed link between anxiety and diabetes, and offers an innovative and evidence-based collaborative care model for anxiety and diabetes in primary care.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by 2 pathogenic defects, impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance. The resultant hyperglycemia causes microvascular and macrovascular complications that increase morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Optimum glycemic control in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus prevents the development of microvascular disease and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular disease. Prandial hyperglycemia may be an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic complications. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of glucose metabolism and describes the results of epidemiological and interventional studies that have demonstrated the association of acute and chronic hyperglycemia with the development of diabetic complications. The American Diabetes Association has defined diagnostic and treatment goals for diabetes mellitus, striving to achieve near-normal glycemic control to delay or prevent the development of diabetic complications. A number of oral antidiabetic agents and insulins are currently available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States. These agents target fasting and postmeal plasma glucose levels to improve glycemic control. Alone or in combination, these agents have enhanced the clinical approaches to treating diabetes mellitus.\"\n",

These features include age of onset of FDM in middle age, association with obesity, residual but declining insulin secretion, development of islet amyloid deposits, loss of approximately 50% of beta-cell mass, and development of complications in several organ systems including peripheral polyneuropathy and retinopathy. Many of the pathological aspects of the disease are also experimentally inducible, facilitating study of the pathogenesis of these lesions. Physiological aspects of FDM and obesity are also well studied in the cat and provide an excellent basis for comparative studies of human T2DM. The relatively short generation time of cats along with breed predispositions to development of FDM may allow for more rapid screening and identification of genetic markers for diabetes susceptibility. FDM, in both spontaneous and inducible forms, therefore provides a good animal model of human T2DM and may provide additional insights into the pathogenesis of this important condition.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a chronic disease increasing rapidly worldwide, is well established as an important risk factor for various types of cancer. Although many factors impact the development of T2DM and cancer including sex, age, ethnicity, obesity, diet, physical activity levels, and environmental exposure, many epidemiological and experimental studies are gradually contributing to knowledge regarding the interrelationship between DM and cancer. The insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and chronic inflammation associated with diabetes mellitus are all associated strongly with cancer. The changes in bioavailable ovarian steroid hormone that occur in diabetes mellitus (the increasing levels of estrogen and androgen and the decreasing level of progesterone) are also considered potentially carcinogenic conditions for the breast, endometrium, and ovaries in women. In addition, the interaction among insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and ovarian steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, could act synergistically during cancer development. Here, we review the cancer-related mechanisms in T2DM, the epidemiological evidence linking T2DM and cancers in women, and the role of antidiabetic medication in these cancers.\"\n",

The severities of insulin resistance and liver damage parallel each other, with the greatest prevalence of cirrhosis occurring in cirrhotics. However, it is unknown whether one of these conditions causes the other, or if both are consequences of another process. Experimental evidence suggests that both insulin resistance and NAFLD result from a chronic inflammatory state. The mechanisms driving this chronic inflammation are unknown but might include the egress of products from intestinal bacteria into the portal blood, liver, and systemic circulation to trigger a sustained inflammatory cytokine response in genetically susceptible individuals. More research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis and to determine the benefits of treatments that interrupt this pathogenic cascade.\"\n",

      "\"Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an incompletely understood chronic, progressive multifactorial disease with insulin resistance and decreased β-cell function playing dominant roles in its genesis.  The worldwide incidence of the disease is rapidly increasing to pandemic proportions.  The increase in incidence of T2DM is attributable to changes in lifestyle, diet and obesity, but other causes remain to be defined.  The disease is a major cause of early mortality due to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and is the leading cause of blindness, leg amputations, and chronic renal disease.  Hyperglycemia inT2DM becomes manifest once insulin secretion is no longer adequate for the metabolic demands of the individual. The approach to glycemic management of the disease is increasingly based on understanding the underlying pathophysiology.  Efforts to maintain and preserve β-cell function during the earlier phases of the disease may have important implications in prevention of subsequent complications of T2DM.  Finally, the approach to glycemic management of the disease should be individualized by considering the psycho-socio-economic condition of each patient, and glycemic targets should reflect presence of comorbid conditions, age of the patient, the stage of their disease in terms of duration, presence of macro- and micro-vascular complications, and propensity for severe hypoglycemia.\"\n",

The incidence of hepatitis C and acute liver failure is also increased. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now considered part of the metabolic syndrome, and, with alcohol and hepatitis C, is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States.

In the past decade, clinicians and scientists across the fields of metabolism, diabetes, liver disease (NAFLD), atherosclerosis, inflammation, infertility, and even cancer have had high hopes about the potential for TZDs to treat many of these diseases. However, an increasing awareness about undesirable \"off-target\" effects of TZDs have made us rethink their role and be more cautious about the long-term benefits and risks related to their use. This review examines the most relevant work on the benefits and risks associated with TZD treatment, with a focus on the only PPARγ agonist currently available (pioglitazone), aiming to offer the reader a balanced overview about the current and future role of TZDs in the management of insulin-resistant states and T2DM.\"\n",

In that context, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) must suffer intervention strategies in order to minimize the risk for diabetes.

      "\"Diabetes mellitus is one of the four priority non-communicable diseases worldwide. It can lead to serious long-term complications and produces significant costs. Due to the chronicle character of the disease, it requires continuous medical treatment and good therapy adherence of those suffering. Therefore, diabetes self-management education (DSME) (and support DSMES) plays a significant role to increase patient's self-management capacity and improve diabetes therapy. Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed. Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behavior or stressor and similar characteristics as the target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA1c, cardiovascular disease risk factors or self-efficacy at a lower cost compared to standard therapy. Peer-supported instant messaging services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared to standard therapy.

      "\"Chronic hyperglycaemia (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes) in humans is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, and, vice versa, the presence of CV complications (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or intermittent claudication) among patients heightens the risk of T2DM or prediabetes. In both cases (i.e. chronic hyperglycaemia and CV complications), significant diagnostic and treatment challenges resulting from a broad range of factors may serve as barriers to reducing the deleterious societal impact of T2DM and prediabetes. These challenges often include clinicians: failing to intervene early and aggressively enough among patients with T2DM to achieve CV risk factor control; failing to efficaciously identify T2DM patients with already established CV complications; and failing proactively to assess individuals at high risk for T2DM. This review discusses the apparent symbiosis between CV disease and T2DM, with a focus on identifying patients with established T2DM or at risk for T2DM; traditional and novel risk factors and markers for CV disease in T2DM; challenges related to diagnosing CV disease in T2DM; and organization of T2DM care in order to prevent CV complications. These are issues that require attention because identifying patients at high risk for T2DM can halt or reduce their further glycaemic deterioration if addressed properly, and because novel markers and non-invasive tests could be applied in patients with T2DM as a means of detecting and possibly treating unrecognized CV disease in time. Furthermore, several approaches for T2DM care can be effective in controlling the CV risk factors contributing to CV complications.\"\n",

      "\"Osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are now prevalent in aging and westernized societies, and adversely affect the health of the elderly people by causing fractures and vascular complications, respectively. Recent experimental and clinical studies show that both disorders are etiologically related to each other through the actions of osteocalcin and adiponectin. Meta-analyses of multiple clinical studies show that hip fracture risk of T2DM patients is increased to 1.4 to 1.7-folds, although BMD of the patients is not diminished. Vertebral fracture risk of T2DM patients is also increased, and BMD is not useful for assessing its risk. These findings suggest that bone fragility in T2DM depends on bone quality deterioration rather than bone mass reduction. Thus, surrogate markers are needed to replace the insensitivity of BMD in assessing fracture risks of T2DM patients. Markers related to advanced glycation end products as well as insulin-like growth factor-I may be such candidates, because these substances were experimentally shown to modulate bone quality in DM. In practice, it is important for physicians to assess fracture risk in T2DM patients by evaluating prior VFs and fracture histories using spine X-ray and interview, respectively, until the usefulness of surrogate markers is established.\"\n",

      "\"Most known pathways of diabetic complications involve oxidative stress. The mitochondria electron transport chain is a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in insulin secretory cells, insulin peripheral sensitive cells and endothelial cells. Elevated intracellular glucose level induces tricarboxylic acid cycle electron donor overproduction and mitochondrial proton gradient increase leading to an increase in electron transporter lifetime. Subsequently, the electrons leaked combine with respiratory oxygen (O(2)) resulting in superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) production. Advanced glycation end products derive ROS via interaction with their receptors. Elevated diacylglycerol and ROS activate the protein kinase C pathway which, in turn, activates NADPH oxidases. A vicious circle of pathway derived ROS installs. Pathologic pathways induced ROS are activated and persistent though glycemia returns to normal due to hyperglycemia memory. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may produce both superoxide anion ((•)O(2)(-)) and nitric oxide (NO) leading to peroxynitrite ((•)ONOO(-)) generation. Homocysteine is also implicated in oxidative stress pathogenesis. In this paper we have highlighted the pathologic mechanisms of ROS on atherosclerosis, renal dysfunction, retina dysfunction and nerve dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. Cell oxidant stress delivery have pivotal role in cell dysfunction onset and progression of angiopathies but an early introduction of good glycemic control may protect cells more efficiently than antioxidants.\"\n",

In this retrospective study, we aim to address whether metformin use prior to admission decreases mortality in patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1356 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus was analyzed by multivariable regression. Covariates that potentially confound the association were further adjusted using propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting.

The metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of disorders including high blood pressure, insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus, visceral obesity and dyslipidaemia with fatty liver disease being a common associated complication. High-throughput gene expression analyses using GeneChips, microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) have been applied to study global gene expression in insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial and polygenic disease by which several organs are affected. Therefore, the identification of both, disease causing and therapeutically relevant target genes is an ambitious challenge. In the present review we focus on genomic approaches that used biopsies from human skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue, the main organs affected by insulin resistance. Members of the PPARgamma coactivator-1 (PGC-1) family of transcriptional coactivators are decreased in skeletal muscle in insulin resistance accounting for the reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Hepatic steatosis is also linked to alterations in mitochondrial phosphorylation and oxidative metabolism. An up regulation of pro-inflammatory genes can be detected in early stages of fatty liver disease without histological signs of inflammation. Impaired adipogenesis, intra-adipose accumulation of macrophages and a sustained release of inflammatory and acute phase proteins are characteristic features of adipose tissue in obesity and may aggravate systemic insulin resistance.\"\n",

We also sought to understand how patients perceived barriers to and facilitators of adherence to medications. Adherence to medications was measured in 72 primary care patients from the West Philadelphia area using electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System caps) over 12 weeks. Standard questions assessed the presence of CVD. Participants answered open-ended questions about barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. Participants who had CVD were significantly less likely to achieve ≥80% adherence to an antidepressant, oral hypoglycemic agent, and antihypertensive medications at 12 weeks. Participants identified four themes related to medication adherence: Interference from Psychosocial Demands, Need for Technological Innovation, Awareness of Disease Severity, and Integrating Community Linkages.

All these measures should be simplified, and sufficiently attractive to be acceptable and accepted by the patient. Weight-loss objectives in overweight diabetic patients should remain within reasonable limits: a few kilogram- loss is sufficient in many cases. In order to maintain the palatability of the diet, the dietary fat intake must be set at sufficient high levels, just by adjusting the carbohydrates/monounsaturates fat balance. When physical training is recommended, this activity must appear as a leisure and not as a constraint.

In the last years, new drugs have been developed. On the one hand, there are agents with beneficial effects not only on blood glucose control but also on the components of metabolic syndrome. Other drugs, according to different experts, have doubtful therapeutical contribution. The appearance of new drugs to treat obesity, associated with diabetes or not, extends other possibilities of choice to take into account. The great variety of options makes the decision of the adequate therapy more difficult. In the last decade, many therapeutic guidelines have been developed, with convergences and divergences that may mislead the inexpert practitioners.

Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention--with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes--and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.\"\n",

      "\"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are characterized by a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (X 7), metabolic syndrome (X 2 to 5) and cardiovascular diseases (X 1,7). Women with lesser degrees of glucose intolerance share the same risks. T2DM may occur from postpartum (5 to 14%) to several years later, up to 25 years. Some factors associated with T2DM are identified: obesity, early diagnostic before 24 weeks, high pregnancy OGTT blood glucose or insulinotherapy. Screening for T2DM only with fasting glucose provides less sensibility than with OGTT; HbA1c may supplant these dosages. The recurrence rate of GDM is between 30 and 84%, non-white ethnicity and insulinotherapy during GDM being the best proven predictors. High risk women need repeated life-long screenings for glycemic abnomalies, or when another pregnancy is planned. Among overweight or obese women with history of GDM who show minor glycoregulation disturbances, it is proved that modifications of lifestyle in intensive programs or metformin halve the risk of DT2. However, studies analysing practices show low adhesion to screening; without an intensive program, few women implement lifestyle modifications. These intensive programs should be implemented and proposed to high-risk women. Their therapeutic education should also include prevention of cardiovascular risk factors.\"\n",

This includes the progressive development of the known complications of diabetes, all of which are extraordinarily like those identified in humans. In addition, for the development and evaluation of new therapeutic agents, the translation of findings from nonhuman primates to application in humans has been highly predictable. Both therapeutic efficacy and identification of potential adverse responses can be effectively examined in nonhuman primates due to their great similarity to humans at the molecular, biochemical, and physiological levels.

      "\"Eighty percent of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overweight or obese, which in turn is associated with other cardiovascular risk factors and an increased risk of cancer. Large intervention studies focused on intensive glycemic control have failed to show a reduction of cardiovascular events in T2DM patients. The two major concerns in these studies were weight gain and severe hypoglycemia in the arms of intensive intervention, which could have mitigated the potential beneficial effect of glycemic control. On the contrary, weight loss in diabetic patients through changes in lifestyle, drugs and/or surgery simultaneously improves all cardiovascular risk factors including hyperglycemia. Bariatric surgery has shown an early resolution of T2DM in a large percentage of patients and a decrease of diabetes-specific mortality. Despite this, all consensus and recommendations for the treatment of T2DM focus their decisions on the glycated hemoglobin value.

When diabetes mellitus is not treated or is poorly controlled, complications of small and large blood vessels arise, and the mortality increases. The costs of treatment of diabetes-related complications are very high.

      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has traditionally been considered a disease of adults. However, in the last 2 decades, it is increasingly being reported in children and adolescents. Obesity is a strong correlate, and the increasing prevalence of obesity and poor physical activity is precipitating type 2 DM at younger ages in the ethnic groups at risk. Indians and other South Asians are among the ethnic groups particularly prone to insulin resistance and type 2 DM, the other racial groups being some American Indian tribes like the Pima Indians, Mexican Americans,Pacific Islanders and African Americans,among others. The WHO has predicted that India will have the greatest number of diabetic individuals in the world by the year 2025. Type 2 DM starting during adolescence puts the individual at risk for major morbidity and even mortality right during the productive years of life. The microvascular complications of DM (nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy) are brought on at an early age. In addition, type 2 DM and obesity are two components of a metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance, the other features of which include hypertension, dyslipidemia and hypercoagulability of blood. All these conditions together increase the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (i.e., myocardial infarction and stroke). The resulting economic burden will be enormous. Type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome are to a large extent preventable. Adoption of a healthy eating and physical activity pattern has resulted in decreasing the development of DM in a few recent studies from various parts of the world. A concerted,multi-pronged effort is needed, involving the general public, pediatricians and general physicians, teachers and schools, the media,the government and professional medical bodies, to generate a momentum towards the goal of prevention of type 2 DM and the insulin resistance syndrome in the young population of India.\"\n",

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are particularly useful for studying these disorders. As in humans, type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes in NHPs and occurs more often in older obese animals, with a metabolic progression from insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes. Histopathologic changes in pancreatic islets are also similar to those seen in humans with diabetes. Initially, there is islet hyperplasia with abundant insulin production to compensate for IR, followed by insufficient insulin production with replacement of islets with islet-associated amyloid. Diabetic NHPs also have adverse changes in plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, biomarkers of obesity, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and protein glycation that contribute to the numerous complications of the disease. Furthermore, sex hormones, pregnancy, and environmental factors (e.g., diet and stress) affect IR and can also contribute to diabetes progression in NHPs. Additionally, due to their similar clinical and pathologic characteristics, NHPs have been used in many pharmacological studies to assess new therapeutic agents. For these reasons, NHPs are particularly valuable animal models of obesity and diabetes for studying disease pathogenesis, risk factors, comorbidities, and therapeutic interventions.\"\n",

      "\"In the recent years, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world. The global epidemic of obesity secondary to physical inactivity and adverse food habits accounts for the alarming rise in NAFLD. Metabolic syndrome plays a major role in the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Whilst most cases of NAFLD remain asymptomatic with only hepatic steatosis, about 30 % progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with chronic liver inflammation that can lead on to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the similar pathogenesis shared between T2DM and NAFLD, T2DM occurs as an important complication in many cases of NAFLD, and many cases of T2DM are further complicated by NAFLD. Rapid progression and increased complications of the individual diseases is the end result of this dual coexistence. Diagnosis of NAFLD relies upon hepatic imaging, serum biochemical markers, and liver biopsy. As in T2DM, the most important management option for patients with NAFLD is lifestyle changes targeted at weight reduction. Other treatment options include insulin sensitizers (metformin and pioglitazone), vitamin E, incretin mimetics, omega-3 fatty acids, cholesterol lowering agents, orlistat, and bariatric surgery.

      "\"Sleep curtailment is common in the Westernised world and coincides with an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review considers the recently published evidence for whether sleep duration is involved in the development of T2DM in human subjects and whether sleep has a role to play in glucose control in people who have diabetes. Data from large, prospective studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and the development of T2DM. Smaller, cross-sectional studies also support a relationship between short sleep duration and the development of both insulin resistance and T2DM. Intervention studies show that sleep restriction leads to insulin resistance, with recent sleep extension studies offering tantalising data showing a potential benefit of sleep extension on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. In people with established diabetes the published literature shows an association between poor glucose control and both short and long sleep durations. However, there are currently no studies that determine the causal direction of this relationship, nor whether sleep interventions are likely to offer benefit for people with diabetes to help them achieve tighter glucose control.\"\n",

The worldwide occurrence of diabetes for all age groups in year 2000 was estimated to be 2.8% and this number is most certainly expected to rise to 4.4% by 2030. Maturity-onset of diabetes of the young, or MODY, is a form of monogenic diabetes that is caused by mutations occurring in a number of different genes. Mutations in different genes tend to cause a slightly different variant of diabetes. MODY is typically diagnosed during late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and is usually observed to develop in adults during their late 50's. One of the main drawbacks in its diagnosis is that many people with MODY are misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a molecular and genetic diagnosis can result in a better treatment and could also help in identifying other family members with MODY. This article explores the historical prospect and the genetic background of MODY, a brief summary of the first case reported and the significant factors that differentiate it from type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\"\n",

      "\"The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise. Given the associated co-morbidities of obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the rising incidence of diabetes has important health consequences and efforts to reduce this incidence are critical. Although lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and exercise, are instrumental in the prevention of diabetes, pharmacological therapies that reduce the incidence of diabetes have the significant potential to lower risk. The results of several large clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) may prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. These trials have demonstrated an approximately 15-30% reduction in the new onset of diabetes in those receiving ACE inhibitors and ARBs when compared with placebo or other active therapy. Although the exact mechanism underlying the effects are not entirely clear, multiple animal and human studies have demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Although future prospective studies to clarify the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in preventing diabetes are ongoing, there is substantial existing evidence from completed trials that these agents may prevent the onset of diabetes.\"\n",
      "\"This paper focused on the relationship between periodontitis and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is an abundance of evidence that diabetes mellitus play important etiological roles in periodontal diseases. In addition, periodontal diseases have powerful and multiple influences on the occurrence and severity of systemic conditions and diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and pregnancy complications. The relationship of periodontitis and diabetes has been supported by sufficient evidences in the past twenty years: (1) diabetes is an independent risk factor of chronic periodontitis; (2) metabolic control will improve the prognosis of chronic periodontitis; (3) the treatment of chronic periodontitis will improve the metabolic level. Our recent investigation on periodontal status in the families of type 2 diabetes mellitus further confirmed the relationship. It was showed that the periodontal index such as probing depth (PD), attachment loss (AL) and numbers of tooth loss in diabetes family members were significantly higher than non-diabetes family members, while no difference of periodontal parameters was found between well control family members and non diabetes family members. In the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its complications, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its receptors were to be recognized as important factors. The distributions of AGEs and the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) are highly consistent in various tissues. One study in our laboratory demonstrated that RAGE was strongly expressed in gingival tissues gathered from T2DM patients with periodontitis compared with systemically healthy chronic periodontitis patients, the expression of RAGE was positively correlated with the expression of TNF-alpha, indicating that AGE-RAGE pathway was involved in the development of periodontitis in T2DM patients. It is known that inflammation could induce the prediabetic status characterized by insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. However, it is still unclear whether periodontitis is a risk factor of type 2 diabetes mellitus or not. In a current study, the effect of periodontitis on serum levels of lipid and glucose of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) patients was implied, as the average serum levels of triglycerides and glucose of a large number of AgP patients were both significantly higher than healthy control group, and serum level of total cholesterol in AgP group was positively associated with the percentage of severe attachment loss sites. It seems that periodontitis may alter serum lipid and glucose levels. Furthermore, the effect of periodontitis on diabetes in an animal study has also demonstrated that experimental moderate periodontitis as well as castration could induce insulin resistance and beta cell impairment in rats, and that combination of the two factors would aggravate the degree of insulin resistance (IR). In conclusion, interrelationship between periodontitis and diabetes has been further approved recently.\"\n",

As for effective diabetes control, there is strong evidence suggesting that better glycemic control can considerably reduce a risk for both micro- and macroangiopathy. To what values glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) should be reduced to prevent complications due to T2D, currently remains an urgent problem. Based on the largest studies dealing with this problem, recommendations have been formulated for different groups of patients: to achieve HbA1c levels of < 7% for all patients; < 6% for those at relatively low risk for hypoglycemia, and in the range from 7.5 to 8% for those at its high risk.\"\n",

There are three aspects: emphasizes the importance of scientific investigation and the classics in TCM, states that spleen deficiency and excessive dampness tend to cause type 2 diabetes mellitus; emphasizes regulating spleen and stomach with acupuncture and formulates acupoint prescription for regulating middle-jiao; emphasizes the evidence based medicine and clinical experiences, seeks the law of treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus.\"\n",
      "\"The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is increasing worldwide. Although recent studies suggest that primary prevention of NIDDM is possible, strategies for controlling the NIDDM pandemic remain under development. Successful interventions to date have mainly relied upon the control of obesity and increased exercise, although pharmacological agents are being studied. While a mixture of both high risk and population-based approaches is likely to be required, the former will not prevent new high risk cases developing. Unfortunately, the success in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease through risk factor reduction has not controlled obesity, the most important risk factor for NIDDM. New strategies are currently being developed and focus upon changes in the food supply of whole populations and a community development approach to altering attitudes to food and exercise. As these interventions are in the early stages of their development, formative, process, and quantitative evaluation remain essential components of any community-based programme aimed at the primary prevention of NIDDM.\"\n",
      "\"This exploratory study, carried out on behalf of an association of German health insurers, the AOK Bundesverband, examined the positive, subjective effects on patients participating in the Westphalia Lippe DMP Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus ('Curaplan', started June 2003) in terms of coping with diabetes and handling the disease. A two-stage qualitative method was selected: First, 250 respondents were questioned using 15-20 minutes half-structured telephone interviews; approximately 40% of the interviewed reported a subjective improvement related to participation in the Curaplan program. In a second step, in-depth interviews were then carried out with 50 of the respondents who had reported a profit from the program. Analyses proceeded in a phenomenon-oriented fashion according to a differentiation and a general psychological-coping perspective. At a differentiation level, eight modes of coping with the illness were reconstructed, for each of which respondents identified a specific improvement. These were: \"Consistent/rational commitment\", \"Discovery-oriented acceptance of challenge\", \"Search for illness-mediated compromise\", \"Anxious quest for increased control\", \"Blinkered denial\", \"Hopelessness\", \"Inability to cope and insecurity\", \"Selfless low prioritization of disease\". At a general level, five central positive dimensions of participation were observed: \"Relationship/not being alone\", \"Meaning/importance\", \"Knowledge/consciousness\", \"Ability to manage/competence gain\", as well as \"Happiness/optimism\". These dimensions complemented and supported one another. The results are not statistically representative but contribute to optimized implementation through psychological understanding of the best cases. Further studies should examine correlations of subjective processes with objective variables.\"\n",

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the treatment cost of hospitalization by type 2 diabetes mellitus and the association of complications and comorbidities with the treatment cost.\"\n",
      "\"The Master Course on \"Methodologies for Bio-Medical Research in Diabetes\" was organized jointly by the University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy, and the Italian Society of Diabetology (SID, Società Italiana di Diabetologia). This Course Program has been active throughout the academic year 2011-2012, and engaged selected students in lectures on diabetes research, training in laboratory work, and personal study on selected review articles and original papers. Lecturing activities involved 26 Italian and international experts in the field of diabetes and metabolism and were highly interactive also involving discussion of experimental data sets. The lectures addressed several aspects of diabetes aetiology, pathophysiology, and management, as well methodological and biotechnology topics. At the end of the Course, students were requested to write a review article on a research topic of their choice.\"\n",
      "\"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous subtype of familial diabetes mellitus characterized by early onset, autosomal dominant inheritance and primary defects of insulin secretion. Mutations in six genes cause most of the MODY cases. These genes encode the enzyme glucokinase and the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha, insulin promoter factor-1, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta and neuroD1. Additional MODY genes remain to be identified. The study of families with MODY has shown that the different MODY subtypes present different metabolic and clinical profiles.\"\n",

      "\"The development of hyperglycemia in the elderly is often multifactorial in etiology, and its presentation is often confounded by the advanced age of the patient, the presence of coexisting diseases and altered mental states, the absence of symptoms, and physical conditions specific to the medical care of the geriatric patient. Manifestations of macro- and microvascular complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) often herald the disease in the elderly, yet there is incomplete knowledge of the natural history of the disease and poor guidelines for its effective management in the geriatric population. Once NIDDM is diagnosed in the older patient, the propensity for these patients to develop atherosclerotic vascular complications involving every organ system and the socioeconomic sequela of the disease make treatment prudent. Coexisting risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as dyshypoproteinemia, hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking, should be treated vigorously, and poor diet, physical inactivity, and medications affecting glucose tolerance modified. Hyperglycemia resistant to nonpharmacologic therapy should be treated with second-generation oral sulfonylureas, and the judicious use of insulin is advised because of a heightened risk for the hazards of hypoglycemia in the elderly. The treatment of NIDDM has important implications in the elderly because of its prevalence and its association with other age-related pathophysiologic processes. Such effective treatment may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of older people.\"\n",
      "\"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common chronic diseases, the incidence of which tends to grow steadily. The great social importance of diabetes mellitus is determined by disability and deaths from late vascular events. So the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the cardiovascular safety of glucose-lowering therapy for T2DM are a multidisciplinary and multi-faceted problem. Its solution requires a comprehensive approach to controlling the risk factors of CVD and assessing hypoglycemic therapy in the context of cardiovascular safety. The paper shows the bases of CVD pathogenesis and contains the results of numerous international clinical trials evaluating the efficiency and safety of current glucose-lowering therapy (metformin and cardioprotective drugs, the action of which is based on their incretin effect).\"\n",
      "\"The prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus dramatically increases with age. Older diabetic subjects have an increased frequency of complications from diabetes compared with their younger counterparts and higher morbidity and mortality rates compared with age-matched non-diabetic controls. Elderly patients with diabetes are generally treated following the same approach as in younger patients: dietary therapy first, followed by oral hypoglycaemic agents and ultimately insulin. However, several specificities should be pointed out. Changes associated with ageing may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of both sulphonylureas (increasing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia) and biguanides (increasing the risk of lactic acidosis). The best insulin regimen in old age is not known, but a twice-daily injection of a pre-mixed insulin preparation is usually recommended. Goals of therapy must be realistic and not cause disabling side-effects. The general practitioner plays a crucial role in the care of elderly diabetic patients, but access to a multidisciplinary specialized team may be necessary.\"\n",
      "\"Diabetes is a chronic illness that affects a disproportionate number of older adults and members of ethnic minorities. It is an illness that requires long-term active patient participation to maintain metabolic control and challenges both the patient and health care provider. The need for the patient to carry out daily self-care behaviors is no less important simply because the person is older. Older adults, however, experience unique challenges because of the physical and functional changes that may be imposed by the aging process and the prevalence of multiple chronic illnesses and complications. Because diabetes self-care is carried out within the context of all aspects of a person's life, it is important, then, for the health professional to recognize these social, functional, and psychological challenges. All aspects of physical, functional, and psychosocial status need to be taken into account, and diabetes education needs to be provided based on jointly identified goals, interests, abilities, and needs.\"\n",

      "\"The authors present a review of current knowledge of insulin mechanism on cellular level and of the defects leading to diminished cellular insulin sensitivity and to development of insulin resistance (IR). Attention is focused primarily on IR in subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with main stress on the postreceptor level of insulin effect which includes glucose transport, storage (glycogen-synthesis) and glycolysis. The defects of these mechanisms (namely the decrease in glycogen-synthase activity) are considered the main causes of IR in patients with NIDDM. Beside the above mentioned factors the authors discuss some of the less well-known mechanisms that can be found in the background of IR in patients with NIDDM (tissue blood flow, capillary density, transport of insulin across the endothelial barrier, glucose toxicity, role of intracellular calcium and others.\"\n",
      "\"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), type 2 diabetes mellitus, was once considered rare in children and adolescents. This is no longer true as NIDDM now accounts for 5% to 45% of new cases of diabetes mellitus in the pediatric age group. Most commonly, this disease is seen in obese children with a family history of NIDDM, and particularly in African American, Native American, and Hispanic children. Acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism are sometimes seen. Pediatric health care providers should be aware of the factors that contribute to the development of NIDDM in children as well as the approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\"\n",
      "\"Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus afflicts ten million Americans (half of whom are undiagnosed) and often is diagnosed only because of its complications. When diagnosed, it is generally treated inadequately. The key to appropriate management is an evaluation of each patient's pathophysiology by careful physical and laboratory examinations. A clear understanding of the therapeutic actions of diet, exercise, sulfonylurea agents, and the new insulins permits the physician to design a specific treatment regimen that can restore normal or near-normal glycemic and lipid control, overcome insulin resistance, and prevent, delay, or slow the course of complications that result from the toxic effects of hyperglycemia.\"\n",
      "\"Bionursing is a series of 12 articles looking at how biological theories should integrate with practice. In the fourth article, the authors describe the case study of an elderly, bereaved woman suffering from incontinence and lack of motivation. They argue that with a physical assessment, the woman's underlying problem of diabetes mellitus would have been diagnosed earlier.\"\n",
      "\"Glycaemic control is a key element in the management of patients with chronic renal insufficiency, associated of course with treatment of all the other associated factors. Dietary management should not merely be wishful thinking but a reality, involving the control of body weight, the maintenance of lean body mass, the observance of a sufficient carbohydrate intake and the control of protein intake, which, always tends to be excessive in diabetics. Drug treatment with oral antidiabetics may be given without risk of iatrogenic effects: glitazone has no effect on renal metabolism but may increase water retention; glinides are insulin secretagogues without renal metabolism so there is no risk of hypoglycaemia in the event of impaired renal function; if not insulin remains an excellent alternative with, however, a change in its half-life with the elevated creatinine clearance. In all cases, the goal remains the control of glycosylated haemoglobin without iatrogenic effects.\"\n",
      "\"This article emphasises the importance of the underlying insulin resistance in NIDDM and its relationship to other associated disorders. The need for screening individuals at risk, with the aim of preventing micro and macrovascular complications, is discussed. Major lifestyle changes are advocated: weight loss, exercise, cessation of smoking and reduction of alcohol intake, dietary changes and self foot care. Patient education and self monitoring of blood glucose play a part in involving the patient in his or her own management. There is much benefit to the patient from the monitoring and early treatment of blood pressure, lipid levels and any diabetic complications that develop.\"\n",
      "\"Factors affecting patient compliance with diet and medication, clinical control, complications, and handicap were studied in 114 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who were attending a hospital diabetic clinic. Compliance with diet and hypoglycemic medication was correlated. The perceived importance, and the ease of compliance were the principal correlates of patient compliance. Factors independently related to diabetic control were compliance with diet, and the quality of the patient's diet. Diabetes which was poorly controlled, and which was of several-years' standing, was more likely to involve complications. Both poor control and the presence of complications contributed to handicap. Increased dietary education and counselling, with emphasis placed on the importance and benefits of compliance with prescribed diets, may improve control, decrease the incidence of complications, and ultimately minimise handicap due to diabetes in non-insulin-dependent patients.\"\n"
