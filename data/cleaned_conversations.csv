Type 2 diabetes and its complications constitute a major worldwide public health problem, affecting almost all populations in both developed and developing countries with high rates of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing exponentially, and a high prevalence rate has been observed in developing countries and in populations undergoing ""westernization"" or modernization. Multiple risk factors of diabetes, delayed diagnosis until micro- and macro-vascular complications arise, life-threatening complications, failure of the current therapies, and financial costs for the treatment of this disease, make it necessary to develop new efficient therapy strategies and appropriate prevention measures for the control of type 2 diabetes. Herein, we summarize our current understanding about the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, the roles of genes, lifestyle and other factors contributing to rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The core aims are to bring forward the new therapy strategies and cost-effective intervention trials of type 2 diabetes.""",genetic factor intervention trial lifestyle treatment type,"""1.

This paper focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients who have or are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and excess fatty acids increase oxidative stress, disrupt protein kinase C signaling and increase advanced glycation end-products that result in vascular inflammation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and atherogenesis. Intensive T2D treatment produces a ≥10% risk reduction in major macrovascular and microvascular events. Glucose-lowering therapies must be individualized. Metformin is an optimal drug for monotherapy. If hemoglobin A1c is not at goal, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor should be considered for therapy with metformin.

The projections estimate that 439 million people will be diabetic in 2030. T2DM is characterized by an impaired β-pancreatic cell function and insulin secretion, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and recently the epigenetic regulation of β-pancreatic cells differentiation has been underlined as being involved. It is currently known that several bioactive molecules, widely abundant in plants used as food or infusions, have a key role in histone modification and DNA methylation, and constituted potential epidrugs candidates against T2DM. In this sense, in this review the epigenetic mechanisms involved in T2DM and protein targets are reviewed, with special focus in studies addressing the potential use of phytochemicals as epidrugs that prevent and/or control T2DM in vivo and in vitro. As main findings, and although some controversial results have been found, bioactive molecules with epigenetic regulatory function, appear to be a potential replacement/complementary therapy of pharmacological hypoglycemic drugs, with minimal side effects. Indeed, natural epidrugs have shown to prevent or delay the T2DM development and the morbidity associated to dysfunction of blood vessels, eyes and kidneys due to sustained hyperglycemia in T2DM patients.""",epidrug epigenetic hyperglycemia phytochemicals protein target type mellitus,"""Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile."", ""Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile."", ""Department of Basic Science, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, Concepción, Chile."", ""Department of Basic Science, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, Concepción, Chile."", ""Scientific-Technological Center for the Sustainable Development of the Coastline, Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion, Concepción, Chile."", ""Natural and Medical Sciences Research Centre, University of Nizwa, Birkat Al Mouz, Oman."", ""Natural and Medical Sciences Research Centre, University of Nizwa, Birkat Al Mouz, Oman."", ""Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Alameda Prof. Hernâni Monteiro, Porto, Portugal."", ""Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal."", ""Laboratory of Neuropsychophysiology, Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal."", ""Phytochemistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."", ""Facultad de Medicina, Universidad del Azuay, Cuenca, Ecuador."", ""Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile."", ""Centre for Healthy Living, University of Concepción, Concepción, Chile."", ""Universidad de Concepción, Unidad de Desarrollo Tecnológico, UDT, Concepción, Chile."", "

These nuts include tree nuts and ground nuts. Tree nut consumption is associated with improved cardio-vascular and inflammatory parameters. However, the consumption of tree nuts is difficult to promote in patients with diabetes because of their high cost. As the main ground nut, peanuts contain a large number of beneficial nutrients, are widely planted, and are affordable for most patients. However, whether peanuts and tree nuts in combination with LCD have similar benefits in patients with T2DM remains unknown; although almonds are the most consumed and studied tree nut. This study sought to compare the effect of peanuts and almonds, incorporated into a LCD, on cardio-metabolic and inflammatory measures in patients with T2DM. Of the 32 T2DM patients that were recruited, 17 were randomly allocated to the Peanut group (n = 17) and 15 to the Almond group (n = 15) in a parallel design. The patients consumed a LCD with part of the starchy staple food being replaced with peanuts (Peanut group) or almonds (Almond group). The follow-up duration was three months. The indicators for glycemic control, other cardio-metabolic, and inflammatory parameters were collected and compared between the two groups. Twenty-five patients completed the study. There were no significant differences in the self-reported dietary compliance between the two groups. Compared with the baseline, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial 2-h blood glucose (PPG) decreased in both the Peanut and Almond groups (p < 0.05). After the intervention, no statistically significant differences were found between the Peanut group and the Almond group with respect to the FBG and PPG levels. A decrease in the glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level from the baseline in the Almond group was found (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups with respect to the HbA1c level at the third month. The peanut and almond consumption did not increase the body mass index (BMI) and had no effect on the blood lipid profile or interleukin-6 (IL-6).In conclusion, incorporated into a LCD, almonds and peanuts have a similar effect on improving fasting and postprandial blood glucose among patients with T2DM.

Metabolic abnormalities including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the main reasons. The prevalence of T2DM in patients with schizophrenia may be epidemiologically frequent because antipsychotics induce weight gain as a side effect and the cognitive dysfunction of patients with schizophrenia relates to a disordered lifestyle, poor diet, and low socioeconomic status. Apart from these common risk factors and risk factors unique to schizophrenia, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of common susceptibility genes between schizophrenia and T2DM. Functional proteins translated from common genetic susceptibility genes are known to regulate neuronal development in the brain and insulin in the pancreas through several common cascades. In this review, we discuss common susceptibility genes, functional cascades, and the relationship between schizophrenia and T2DM. Many genetic and epidemiological studies have reliably associated the comorbidity of schizophrenia and T2DM, and it is probably safe to think that common cascades and mechanisms suspected from common genes' functions are related to the onset of both schizophrenia and T2DM. On the other hand, even when genetic analyses are performed on a relatively large number of comorbid patients, the results are sometimes inconsistent, and susceptibility genes may carry only a low or moderate risk.

Determinants were further categorized into physical, psychosocial and health-related domains. Fear of falling and low balance confidence were highly prevalent and more severe in older adults with type 2 diabetes. Determinants of fear of falling and balance confidence occurred beyond the physical domain and the presence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Targeted group-based interventions (e.g. gait and balance training, tai chi, yoga) appear to be beneficial in reducing fear of falling and improving balance confidence.

However, the development of this association over time and the quantification of the strength of this association for individual BCAAs prior to T2DM diagnosis remains unexplored. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using the Healthcare Databases Advance Search (HDAS) via the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website. The data sources included EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed for all papers from inception until November 2021. Nine studies were identified in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Stratification was based on follow-up times (0−6, 6−12 and 12 or more years) and controlling of body mass index (BMI) through the specific assessment of overweight cohorts was also undertaken. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between BCAA concentrations and the development of T2DM, with valine OR = 2.08 (95% CI = 2.04−2.12, p < 0.00001), leucine OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.76−2.87, p < 0.00001) and isoleucine OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 2.00−2.25, p < 0.00001. In addition, we demonstrated a positive consistent temporal association between circulating BCAA levels and the risk of developing T2DM with differentials in the respective follow-up times of 0−6 years, 6−12 years and ≥12 years follow-up for valine (OR = 2.08, 1.86 and 2.14, p < 0.05 each), leucine (OR = 2.10, 2.25 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) and isoleucine (OR = 2.12, 1.90 and 2.16, p < 0.05 each) demonstrated.

In this regard, the latest studies have shown the increasing trends for the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. ROS are highly reactive species and almost all cellular components are chemically changed due to the influence of ROS that ultimately results in the production of lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation is a major causative factor for the development of oxidative stress that leads to overt T2DM and its associated micro- and macro-vascular complications. In this article, we have briefly described the role of various causative factors, transcriptional and metabolic pathways which are responsible to increase the production of oxidative stress, a most pivotal factor for the pathogenesis and development of T2DM. Therefore, we conclude that measurement of oxidative stress biomarkers may be one of the optional tool for the diagnosis and prediction of T2DM.

Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.""",abnormal insulin secretion disease trajectory hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance prediabetes,"""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China."", ""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China."", ""School of Physical Education & Sports Science, South China Normal University, No.55, West of Zhongshan Ave., Tianhe District, Guangzhou City, 510006, Guangdong Province, China. wangsongtao@m.scnu.edu.cn."", "

Obesity currently costs the Canadian economy approximately $7.1 billion annually whereas per capita health care cost for individuals with diabetes are 3 to 4 times that for persons without the disease. Each kilogram of weight lost through health behaviour changes in people with impaired glucose tolerance is associated with a relative diabetes risk reduction of 16%. As 80% to 90% of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, and adiposity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes, weight loss is recommended as the cornerstone management measure. A modest weight loss of 5% to 10% is an achievable and realistic goal for preventing type 2 diabetes in susceptible individuals and improving glycemic and metabolic control in people with type 2 diabetes.

Globally, the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has become a significant international public health concern. In view of the heavy societal burden caused by diabetes, and further, to reduce its growing incidence, it is clearly essential to understand the causes of this disease and to devise more effective strategies for its treatment. Although many factors cause T2DM, this article centers on the role of circadian regulation of metabolism. The correlation between the increased occurrence of T2DM and the ubiquity of modern social pressures such as 24/7 lifestyles as well as nocturnal lighting conditions point strongly to the hypothesis that malfunctioning of circadian controls may be involved in the etiology of the illness. Nocturnal light exposure, unusual timing of food, irregular sleep/wake schedules and traveling between different time zones are some of the factors responsible for improper entrainment of the clock. Recent reports have proposed that strengthening of circadian clock functioning and proper timing of food intake could stabilize glucose homeostasis. This strategy thus represents a chronotherapeutic option for non-pharmaceutical intervention in treating T2DM patients.""",circadian rhythms clock genes melatonin metabolism type mellitus,"""Department of Animal Behaviour, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai 625 021, Tamil Nadu, India."", ""Department of Animal Behaviour, School of Biological Sciences, Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai 625 021, Tamil Nadu, India.

In clinical practice, many commonly prescribed medications can alter the patient's lipid profile and, potentially, the risk for ASCVD-either favorably or unfavorably. The dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can be characterized as both ominous and cryptic, in terms of unrecognized, disproportionately elevated atherogenic cholesterol particle concentrations, in spite of deceptively and relatively lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Several factors, most notably insulin resistance, associated with the unfavorable discordance of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have been shown to correlate with an increased risk/number of ASCVD events in patients with T2DM. This review focuses on known changes in the routine lipid profile (LDL-C, TGs, and HDL-C) observed with commonly prescribed medications for patients with T2DM, including antihyperglycemic agents, antihypertensive agents, weight loss medications, antibiotics, analgesics, oral contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapies. Given that the risk of ASCVD is already elevated for patients with T2DM, the use of polypharmacy may warrant close observation of overall alterations through ongoing lipid-panel monitoring.

Thiazolidinediones are known as insulin sensitizers and are effective for a longer duration in comparison to sulfonylureas, however, have side effects such as fluid retention, edema and heart failure. Incretin mimetics including exenatide and liraglutide act through increase in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, in a glucose-dependent manner.

Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit clinical and subclinical symptoms of anxiety more frequently than people without diabetes. Anxiety is traditionally associated with poor metabolic outcomes and increased medical complications among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Collaborative care models have been utilized in the multidisciplinary treatment of mental health problems and chronic disease, and have demonstrated success in managing the pathology of depression which often accompanies diabetes. However, no specific treatment model has been published that links the treatment of anxiety to the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the success of collaborative care models in treating depression associated with diabetes, and anxiety unrelated to chronic disease, it is possible that the collaborative care treatment of primary care patients who suffer from both anxiety and diabetes could be met with the same success. The key issue is determining how to implement and sustain these models in practice. This review summarizes the proposed link between anxiety and diabetes, and offers an innovative and evidence-based collaborative care model for anxiety and diabetes in primary care.""",anxiety collaborative care comorbidity primary care,"""Department of Family Medicine, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, NC 28207, USA Allison.bickett@carolinashealthcare.org."", ""Department of Family Medicine, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, NC 28207, USA."", "

Research indicates that these outcomes might be difficult to maintain. Consequently, effective strategies to preserve the positive effects of DSMES are needed. Preliminary results show that peer support, which means support from a person who has experiential knowledge of a specific behavior or stressor and similar characteristics as the target population, is associated with better outcomes in terms of HbA1c, cardiovascular disease risk factors or self-efficacy at a lower cost compared to standard therapy. Peer-supported instant messaging services (IMS) approaches have significant potential for diabetes management because support can be provided easily and prompt, is inexpensive, and needs less effort to attend compared to standard therapy.

We also sought to understand how patients perceived barriers to and facilitators of adherence to medications. Adherence to medications was measured in 72 primary care patients from the West Philadelphia area using electronic monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System caps) over 12 weeks. Standard questions assessed the presence of CVD. Participants answered open-ended questions about barriers to and facilitators of medication adherence. Participants who had CVD were significantly less likely to achieve ≥80% adherence to an antidepressant, oral hypoglycemic agent, and antihypertensive medications at 12 weeks. Participants identified four themes related to medication adherence: Interference from Psychosocial Demands, Need for Technological Innovation, Awareness of Disease Severity, and Integrating Community Linkages.

This review considers the recently published evidence for whether sleep duration is involved in the development of T2DM in human subjects and whether sleep has a role to play in glucose control in people who have diabetes. Data from large, prospective studies indicate a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and the development of T2DM. Smaller, cross-sectional studies also support a relationship between short sleep duration and the development of both insulin resistance and T2DM. Intervention studies show that sleep restriction leads to insulin resistance, with recent sleep extension studies offering tantalising data showing a potential benefit of sleep extension on glucose control and insulin sensitivity. In people with established diabetes the published literature shows an association between poor glucose control and both short and long sleep durations. However, there are currently no studies that determine the causal direction of this relationship, nor whether sleep interventions are likely to offer benefit for people with diabetes to help them achieve tighter glucose control.""",hr hazard ratio tdm type mellitus circadian clock glucose insulin resistance sleep,"""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", ""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", ""Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds,Leeds,UK."", "

Nazir, ","""Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)--history, first case reports and recent advances."", ",2015,"""The world is seemingly facing a global increase in people suffering from diabetes especially in developing countries. The worldwide occurrence of diabetes for all age groups in year 2000 was estimated to be 2.8% and this number is most certainly expected to rise to 4.4% by 2030. Maturity-onset of diabetes of the young, or MODY, is a form of monogenic diabetes that is caused by mutations occurring in a number of different genes. Mutations in different genes tend to cause a slightly different variant of diabetes. MODY is typically diagnosed during late childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood and is usually observed to develop in adults during their late 50's. One of the main drawbacks in its diagnosis is that many people with MODY are misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. However, a molecular and genetic diagnosis can result in a better treatment and could also help in identifying other family members with MODY. This article explores the historical prospect and the genetic background of MODY, a brief summary of the first case reported and the significant factors that differentiate it from type 1 and type 2 diabetes.""",first case report genetics mody mutation sub types,"""Strategic Center for Diabetes Research, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
